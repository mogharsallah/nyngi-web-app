# AI SDK UI

AI SDK UI is designed to help you build interactive chat, completion, and assistant applications with ease. It is a **framework-agnostic toolkit**, streamlining the integration of advanced AI functionalities into your applications.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently. With three main hooks — **`useChat`**, **`useCompletion`**, and **`useObject`** — you can incorporate real-time chat capabilities, text completions, streamed JSON, and interactive assistant features into your app.

- **[`useChat`](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot)** offers real-time streaming of chat messages, abstracting state management for inputs, messages, loading, and errors, allowing for seamless integration into any UI design.
- **[`useCompletion`](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/completion)** enables you to handle text completions in your applications, managing the prompt input and automatically updating the UI as new completions are streamed.
- **[`useObject`](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/object-generation)** is a hook that allows you to consume streamed JSON objects, providing a simple way to handle and display structured data in your application.

These hooks are designed to reduce the complexity and time required to implement AI interactions, letting you focus on creating exceptional user experiences.
