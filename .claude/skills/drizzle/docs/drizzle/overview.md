# Drizzle

> Drizzle is a modern TypeScript ORM developers wanna use in their next project. It is lightweight at only ~7.4kb minified+gzipped, and it's tree shakeable with exactly 0 dependencies. It supports every PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and SingleStore database and is serverless-ready by design.
