## Why Use the Agent Class?

The Agent class is the recommended approach for building agents with the AI SDK because it:

- **Reduces boilerplate** - Manages loops and message arrays
- **Improves reusability** - Define once, use throughout your application
- **Simplifies maintenance** - Single place to update agent configuration

For most use cases, start with the Agent class. Use core functions (`generateText`, `streamText`) when you need explicit control over each step for complex structured workflows.
