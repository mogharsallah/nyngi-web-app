## `generateText`

You can generate text using the [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text) function. This function is ideal for non-interactive use cases where you need to write text (e.g. drafting email or summarizing web pages) and for agents that use tools.

```tsx
import { generateText } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

You can use more [advanced prompts](./prompts) to generate text with more complex instructions and content:

```tsx
import { generateText } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  system:
    'You are a professional writer. ' +
    'You write simple, clear, and concise content.',
  prompt: `Summarize the following article in 3-5 sentences: ${article}`,
});
```

The result object of `generateText` contains several promises that resolve when all required data is available:

- `result.content`: The content that was generated in the last step.
- `result.text`: The generated text.
- `result.reasoning`: The full reasoning that the model has generated in the last step.
- `result.reasoningText`: The reasoning text of the model (only available for some models).
- `result.files`: The files that were generated in the last step.
- `result.sources`: Sources that have been used as references in the last step (only available for some models).
- `result.toolCalls`: The tool calls that were made in the last step.
- `result.toolResults`: The results of the tool calls from the last step.
- `result.finishReason`: The reason the model finished generating text.
- `result.rawFinishReason`: The raw reason why the generation finished (from the provider).
- `result.usage`: The usage of the model during the final step of text generation.
- `result.totalUsage`: The total usage across all steps (for multi-step generations).
- `result.warnings`: Warnings from the model provider (e.g. unsupported settings).
- `result.request`: Additional request information.
- `result.response`: Additional response information, including response messages and body.
- `result.providerMetadata`: Additional provider-specific metadata.
- `result.steps`: Details for all steps, useful for getting information about intermediate steps.
- `result.output`: The generated structured output using the `output` specification.

### Accessing response headers & body

Sometimes you need access to the full response from the model provider,
e.g. to access some provider-specific headers or body content.

You can access the raw response headers and body using the `response` property:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result.response.headers, null, 2));
console.log(JSON.stringify(result.response.body, null, 2));
```

### `onFinish` callback

When using `generateText`, you can provide an `onFinish` callback that is triggered after the last step is finished (
[API Reference](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text#on-finish)
).
It contains the text, usage information, finish reason, messages, steps, total usage, and more:

```tsx highlight="6-8"
import { generateText } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  onFinish({ text, finishReason, usage, response, steps, totalUsage }) {
    // your own logic, e.g. for saving the chat history or recording usage

    const messages = response.messages; // messages that were generated
  },
});
```
