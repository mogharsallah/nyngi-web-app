# LM Studio Provider

[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) is a user interface for running local models.

It contains an OpenAI compatible API server that you can use with the AI SDK.
You can start the local server under the [Local Server tab](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/basics/server) in the LM Studio UI ("Start Server" button).
