# Reading UI Message Streams

`UIMessage` streams are useful outside of traditional chat use cases. You can consume them for terminal UIs, custom stream processing on the client, or React Server Components (RSC).

The `readUIMessageStream` helper transforms a stream of `UIMessageChunk` objects into an `AsyncIterableStream` of `UIMessage` objects, allowing you to process messages as they're being constructed.
