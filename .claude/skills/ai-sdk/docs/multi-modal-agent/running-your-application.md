## Running Your Application

With that, you have built everything you need for your multi-modal agent! To start your application, use the command:

<Snippet text="pnpm run dev" />

Head to your browser and open http://localhost:3000. You should see an input field and a button to upload files.

Try uploading an image or PDF and asking the model questions about it. Watch as the model's response is streamed back to you!
