## Conclusion

The AI SDK offers a powerful and flexible way to integrate cutting-edge AI models like Llama 3.1 into your applications. With AI SDK Core, you can seamlessly switch between different AI models and providers by changing just two lines of code. This flexibility allows for quick experimentation and adaptation, reducing the time required to change models from days to minutes.

The AI SDK ensures that your application remains clean and modular, accelerating development and future-proofing against the rapidly evolving landscape.
