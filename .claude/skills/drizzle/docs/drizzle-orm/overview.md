# Drizzle ORM  
> Drizzle is a good friend who's there for you when necessary and doesn't bother when you need some space.

Drizzle ORM is a headless TypeScript ORM with a head. 🐲

It looks and feels simple, performs on day _1000_ of your project, 
lets you do things your way, and is there when you need it.  

**It's the only ORM with both [relational](/docs/rqb) and [SQL-like](/docs/select) query APIs**, 
providing you the best of both worlds when it comes to accessing your relational data. 
Drizzle is lightweight, performant, typesafe, non-lactose, gluten-free, sober, flexible and **serverless-ready by design**.
Drizzle is not just a library, it's an experience. 🤩
