## Embedding Similarity

After embedding values, you can calculate the similarity between them using the [`cosineSimilarity`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/cosine-similarity) function.
This is useful to e.g. find similar words or phrases in a dataset.
You can also rank and filter related items based on their similarity.

```ts highlight={"2,10"}
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { cosineSimilarity, embedMany } from 'ai';

const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
  values: ['sunny day at the beach', 'rainy afternoon in the city'],
});

console.log(
  `cosine similarity: ${cosineSimilarity(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])}`,
);
```
