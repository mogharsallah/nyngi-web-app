# Perplexity Provider

The [Perplexity](https://sonar.perplexity.ai) provider offers access to Sonar API - a language model that uniquely combines real-time web search with natural language processing. Each response is grounded in current web data and includes detailed citations, making it ideal for research, fact-checking, and obtaining up-to-date information.

API keys can be obtained from the [Perplexity Platform](https://docs.perplexity.ai).
