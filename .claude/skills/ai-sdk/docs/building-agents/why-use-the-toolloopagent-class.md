## Why Use the ToolLoopAgent Class?

When building AI applications, you often need to:

- **Reuse configurations** - Same model settings, tools, and prompts across different parts of your application
- **Maintain consistency** - Ensure the same behavior and capabilities throughout your codebase
- **Simplify API routes** - Reduce boilerplate in your endpoints
- **Type safety** - Get full TypeScript support for your agent's tools and outputs

The ToolLoopAgent class provides a single place to define your agent's behavior.
