## Routing

This pattern lets the model decide which path to take through a workflow based on context and intermediate results. The model acts as an intelligent router, directing the flow of execution between different branches of your workflow. Use this when handling varied inputs that require different processing approaches. In the example below, the first LLM call's results determine the second call's model size and system prompt.

```ts
import { generateObject, generateText } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

async function handleCustomerQuery(query: string) {
  const model = __MODEL__;

  // First step: Classify the query type
  const { object: classification } = await generateObject({
    model,
    schema: z.object({
      reasoning: z.string(),
      type: z.enum(['general', 'refund', 'technical']),
      complexity: z.enum(['simple', 'complex']),
    }),
    prompt: `Classify this customer query:
    ${query}

    Determine:
    1. Query type (general, refund, or technical)
    2. Complexity (simple or complex)
    3. Brief reasoning for classification`,
  });

  // Route based on classification
  // Set model and system prompt based on query type and complexity
  const { text: response } = await generateText({
    model:
      classification.complexity === 'simple'
        ? 'openai/gpt-4o-mini'
        : 'openai/o4-mini',
    system: {
      general:
        'You are an expert customer service agent handling general inquiries.',
      refund:
        'You are a customer service agent specializing in refund requests. Follow company policy and collect necessary information.',
      technical:
        'You are a technical support specialist with deep product knowledge. Focus on clear step-by-step troubleshooting.',
    }[classification.type],
    prompt: query,
  });

  return { response, classification };
}
```
