## Event Handler

First, let's take a look at our API route (`api/events.ts`):

```typescript
import type { SlackEvent } from '@slack/web-api';
import {
  assistantThreadMessage,
  handleNewAssistantMessage,
} from '../lib/handle-messages';
import { waitUntil } from '@vercel/functions';
import { handleNewAppMention } from '../lib/handle-app-mention';
import { verifyRequest, getBotId } from '../lib/slack-utils';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const rawBody = await request.text();
  const payload = JSON.parse(rawBody);
  const requestType = payload.type as 'url_verification' | 'event_callback';

  // See https://api.slack.com/events/url_verification
  if (requestType === 'url_verification') {
    return new Response(payload.challenge, { status: 200 });
  }

  await verifyRequest({ requestType, request, rawBody });

  try {
    const botUserId = await getBotId();

    const event = payload.event as SlackEvent;

    if (event.type === 'app_mention') {
      waitUntil(handleNewAppMention(event, botUserId));
    }

    if (event.type === 'assistant_thread_started') {
      waitUntil(assistantThreadMessage(event));
    }

    if (
      event.type === 'message' &&
      !event.subtype &&
      event.channel_type === 'im' &&
      !event.bot_id &&
      !event.bot_profile &&
      event.bot_id !== botUserId
    ) {
      waitUntil(handleNewAssistantMessage(event, botUserId));
    }

    return new Response('Success!', { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating response', error);
    return new Response('Error generating response', { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

This file defines a `POST` function that handles incoming requests from Slack. First, you check the request type to see if it's a URL verification request. If it is, you respond with the challenge string provided by Slack. If it's an event callback, you verify the request and then have access to the event data. This is where you can implement your event handling logic.

You then handle three types of events: `app_mention`, `assistant_thread_started`, and `message`:

- For `app_mention`, you call `handleNewAppMention` with the event and the bot user ID.
- For `assistant_thread_started`, you call `assistantThreadMessage` with the event.
- For `message`, you call `handleNewAssistantMessage` with the event and the bot user ID.

Finally, you respond with a success message to Slack. Note, each handler function is wrapped in a `waitUntil` function. Let's take a look at what this means and why it's important.

### The waitUntil Function

Slack expects a response within 3 seconds to confirm the request is being handled. However, generating AI responses can take longer. If you don't respond to the Slack request within 3 seconds, Slack will send another request, leading to another invocation of your API route, another call to the LLM, and ultimately another response to the user. To solve this, you can use the `waitUntil` function, which allows you to run your AI logic after the response is sent, without blocking the response itself.

This means, your API endpoint will:

1. Immediately respond to Slack (within 3 seconds)
2. Continue processing the message asynchronously
3. Send the AI response when it's ready
