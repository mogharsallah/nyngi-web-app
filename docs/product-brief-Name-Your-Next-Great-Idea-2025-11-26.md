# Product Brief: Name Your Next Great Idea

**Context:** Greenfield Implementation / Strategic Execution

## Executive Summary

"Name Your Next Great Idea" is a new platform designed to disrupt the commoditized AI naming market by functioning as a "Launch Certainty Engine." Unlike existing tools that prioritize volume, this platform is built from the ground up to address the "Legal Chasm"—the gap between creative ideation and trademark safety. It serves two distinct personas: the Lean Entrepreneur (seeking speed and hosting bundles) and the High-Stakes Founder (seeking legal certainty and brand defensibility). The core value proposition is to de-risk the naming process, monetizing user anxiety through a "Trojan Horse" model that leverages low-cost "De-Risking Reports" to drive high-margin affiliate hosting revenue and legal lead generation.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

The market is saturated with "keyword masher" tools that prioritize speed and volume over quality and safety. This creates a "Legal Chasm": users fall in love with AI-generated names that are often legally indefensible, exposing them to significant litigation risks ($120k-$750k). Furthermore, generic output fails to inspire, leading to wasted time and frustration for entrepreneurs seeking a brand identity with depth.

### Problem Impact

- **Financial Risk:** Unmitigated trademark infringement risks can bankrupt a new venture.
- **Opportunity Cost:** "Lean Entrepreneurs" waste critical launch momentum filtering through thousands of unusable names.
- **Brand Dilution:** Widespread use of generic AI names increases customer confusion and weakens brand distinctiveness.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Commoditized Utility:** Competitors focus on "brainstorming" rather than "launching," leaving the user to navigate the complex legal landscape alone.
- **False Security:** Basic domain availability checks are presented as "validation," misleading users into thinking a name is safe to use as a trademark.
- **Lack of Strategic Depth:** Most tools lack the nuance of a human naming consultant, producing names that are linguistically flat and strategically misaligned.

### Proposed Solution

A "Launch Certainty Engine" that integrates advanced creative generation with rigorous legal validation.

1.  **Elevated Creative Quality:** Uses "Naming Book" methodologies (Tone Matrix, Sound Waveform) to generate metaphorically rich, "Fanciful/Arbitrary" names.
2.  **Risk Mitigation:** A "Traffic Light" system and "Multi-Jurisdictional IP Safety Score" provide immediate, actionable legal feedback.
3.  **Monetization of Anxiety:** A "Trojan Horse" model that sells certainty (De-Risking Reports) and infrastructure (Hosting) rather than just names.

### Key Differentiators

- **The "Trojan Horse" Model:** Monetizes the _fear_ of legal risk to drive high-margin affiliate and lead-gen revenue, rather than relying on low-margin subscriptions.
- **IP Safety First:** The only platform that treats "Legal Certainty" as the primary product, targeting a <0.5% False Negative Rate.
- **Consultative AI:** Features like the "Narrative Architect" and "Tone Matrix" mimic the strategic guidance of a human branding agency.

## Success Metrics

### Business Objectives

1.  **Validate the "Trojan Horse" Model:** Prove that users can be converted from "free naming" to "paid certainty" and "affiliate hosting."
2.  **Establish Technical Credibility:** Achieve a False Negative Rate (FNR) of <0.5% in IP safety scoring to secure the trust of High-Stakes Founders.
3.  **Maximize Unit Economics:** Ensure the combined revenue from Reports ($7.99), Hosting ($65-$200), and Legal Leads ($150+) exceeds the Cost of Acquisition (CAC).

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Conversion Rate (Report):** Target 5.0% - 8.0% of users purchasing the $7.99 De-Risking Report.
- **Conversion Rate (Hosting):** Target 0.5% - 1.0% of users converting to affiliate hosting (HostGator/WP Engine).
- **Conversion Rate (Legal Lead):** Target 15% - 25% of "High Risk" users converting to attorney consultation.
- **IP Safety Accuracy:** >99.5% Infringement Detection Accuracy.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features

1.  **Narrative Architect (Lite):** Chat-based interface for ingesting user criteria (Industry, Description, Tone) and generating names.
2.  **Traffic Light Risk System:** Real-time visual feedback (Green/Amber/Red) based on preliminary IP checks.
3.  **$7.99 De-Risking Report Gateway:** Secure checkout and PDF generation engine for the "Amber" path.
4.  **Launch Readiness Checklist:** Dynamic "To-Do" list that injects affiliate hosting links (HostGator/WP Engine) based on user persona.
5.  **Integrated Legal Filing Pathway:** Lead generation form for the "Red" path to route high-risk users to attorneys.

### Out of Scope for MVP

- **Brand Canvas (Spatial UI):** Infinite 2D canvas for organizing names (High effort, low MVP impact).
- **Proprietary Legal Database:** Will use 3rd party APIs (Trademarkia, USPTO) instead of building a custom index.
- **Logo Maker:** Commoditized feature that distracts from the core "Naming & Certainty" value prop.
- **Social Handle Reservor:** Lower priority than Domain/Trademark validation.

### MVP Success Criteria

- Functional "Trojan Horse" funnel: User -> Name -> Risk Flag -> Payment/Affiliate Link.
- Integration with at least one major Trademark API and one Affiliate Network.
- Ability to generate "Elevated Creative" names that pass a basic internal quality review.

## Market Context

The Generative AI market is growing at 39.6% CAGR, but the "Naming" segment is racing to the bottom on utility. Competitors (Namelix, Looka) focus on volume. "Name Your Next Great Idea" differentiates by focusing on **Certainty**. The market opportunity lies in the "Legal Chasm"—monetizing the risk that competitors ignore.

## Financial Considerations

- **Affiliate Arbitrage:** The business model relies on the "Profit Wedge" where high-margin hosting commissions ($65-$200) subsidize the cost of user acquisition, making the naming tool effectively a loss leader.
- **Legal Lead Margins:** High-risk names are not failures but revenue opportunities ($150-$300 CPL), turning technical limitations (AI hallucination risk) into financial assets.

## Technical Preferences

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React) for SEO and performance.
- **AI:** LLM integration for "Narrative Architect" and "Creative Generation."
- **Data:** Integration with 3rd party Trademark APIs (Trademarkia/USPTO).
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel for hosting/deployment.

## Risks and Assumptions

- **AI Hallucination:** Risk that AI misidentifies a trademark infringement (False Negative). _Mitigation:_ Strict disclaimers and a conservative "Red Light" threshold that pushes users to human attorneys.
- **API Costs:** High volume of trademark searches could be costly. _Mitigation:_ Caching strategies and tiered checks (basic exact match first, deep search only for paid/high-intent users).
- **Affiliate Dependency:** Revenue is heavily dependent on hosting affiliate programs. _Mitigation:_ Diversify with direct sales (De-Risking Report) and Legal Lead Gen.
