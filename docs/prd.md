# **Product Roadmap**

## **1\. Executive Strategy and Ecosystem Architecture**

### **1.1 The Strategic Pivot: From Utility to Certainty**

The digital naming ecosystem is currently defined by a pervasive "race to the bottom" in terms of utility. The market is saturated with competitors that prioritize velocity and sheer volume, utilizing basic Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate thousands of generic, often legally hazardous suggestions in mere seconds. This commoditization of ideation has created a critical vulnerability in the user journey, referred to herein as the "Legal Chasm"—a dangerous gap between the creative excitement of finding a name and the existential dread of trademark infringement.

Our strategic thesis posits that the next market leader will not be the tool that generates the _most_ names, but the platform that provides the _most certainty_. The product vision, therefore, must pivot fundamentally from a simple "Brainstorming Tool" to a "Launch Certainty Engine." This engine creates value through two primary, interlinked mechanisms. First, the **Creative Hook (Aspiration)** operationalizes the rigorous methodology of _The Naming Book_ to produce "Elevated Creative Quality" that outperforms generic keyword mashers. Second, the **Monetization of Anxiety (Validation)** converts the user's fear of litigation into high-margin revenue streams via legal lead generation and "Launch Readiness" affiliate bundles.

The necessity of this pivot is underscored by the dual mandate of creative aspiration and legal certainty.1 The market failure of commoditized ideation has left users exposed to significant legal liabilities, as prevailing platforms encourage commitment to names that are often legally indefensible.2 By transforming the value proposition from "help me brainstorm" to "help me launch safely," the platform addresses the "Legal Chasm" directly, leveraging the user's anxiety as a primary conversion driver.2

### **1.2 The "Trojan Horse" Unit Economics**

The roadmap is dictated not just by user needs, but by the unit economics of the "Trojan Horse" monetization model. Understanding these economics is prerequisite to understanding the prioritization decisions made throughout this report. The financial architecture relies on three distinct pillars that align with user psychographics and market realities.

The Volume Driver (Affiliate Hosting)  
Research indicates that domain registration commissions are negligible, typically ranging from $2 to $5 per transaction.2 However, web hosting commissions are substantial and serve as the primary revenue engine for the "Lean Entrepreneur" segment. Affiliate programs like HostGator offer tiered payouts ranging from $65 to $125 per sale, depending on volume.3 Premium managed hosting providers like WP Engine offer significantly higher payouts, often starting at $200 per conversion or 100% of the first month's revenue.5 Therefore, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) must functionally and psychologically link the act of "naming" to the act of "hosting," treating the name merely as the entry point to the lucrative infrastructure purchase.  
The Margin Driver (Legal Leads)  
For the "High-Stakes Founder," the platform functions as a highly qualified lead generation engine for trademark attorneys. Exclusive legal leads for intellectual property can command prices between $150 and $300 per lead, with some high-value personal injury leads reaching up to $1,000.6 This revenue stream relies entirely on the platform's ability to detect "High Risk" names accurately and effectively "scare" the user into professional consultation. The economic logic here is that the cost of litigation ($120,000 \- $750,000) makes the lead generation fee negligible for the user, while providing high margins for the platform.1  
The Liquidation Layer (Micro-transactions)  
A $7.99 "De-Risking Report" serves primarily to liquidate the cost of user acquisition (CAC). By pricing this report under the impulse-buy threshold of $10, the platform effectively makes the traffic free, ensuring that the affiliate and lead-gen revenue streams become pure profit.2 This micro-transaction also acts as a "Trust Builder," unlocking the backend affiliate ecosystem and validating the user's intent before pushing higher-ticket items.

### **1.3 User Segmentation and Psychographics**

The platform serves two distinct personas, each requiring a tailored user journey and monetization strategy.

Primary Persona: The Lean Entrepreneur  
This segment comprises small business owners, solopreneurs, and dropshippers who are acutely budget-sensitive and prioritize speed. They view naming as a task to be completed so they can proceed to revenue generation.2 Their user journey is designed as an "Accelerated Flow," minimizing friction while subtly educating them on risks. They are the primary source of volume traffic for the affiliate hosting engine.  
Secondary Persona: The High-Stakes Founder  
This segment includes VC-backed startups and agency consultants who view the name as a defensible asset. They have a near-zero tolerance for legal risk and are willing to pay premiums for certainty.1 Their user journey is a "Comprehensive Flow" that enforces strategic rigor and deep validation. They are the target for the high-margin legal lead generation and subscription services.

## **2\. Comprehensive Feature Discovery: The Master List**

To operationalize _The Naming Book_ "to the teeth" and execute the monetization strategy, we have identified a comprehensive list of potential features. These are categorized by their functional role in the user journey: **Input (Criteria), Generation (Creative), Validation (Risk), and Monetization (Conversion).**

### **2.1 Category A: The "Naming Book" Criteria Injection (Inputs)**

These features are strictly derived from the methodology outlined by Brad Flowers in _The Naming Book_. They are designed to replace the "blank page" with structured strategic constraints, transforming the naming process from a guessing game into an engineered exercise.

#### **A1. The Tone Matrix & Conflict Engine**

- **Description:** A multi-select interface allowing users to choose brand personality traits (e.g., Modern, Playful, Authority) from a curated list derived from the book's methodology.
- **"Naming Book" Rationale:** Flowers argues that tones act as guardrails; a brand cannot be all things to all people. The critical insight is that tones can be contradictory.8
- **Mechanism:** The system includes a "Conflict Resolution" engine. If a user selects "Exclusive" and "Accessible," the engine triggers a prompt: "These tones contradict. Which is primary?" This mimics the role of a human consultant, forcing the user to make strategic trade-offs early in the process.
- **Strategic Value:** This feature educates the user and ensures the AI has a coherent "Brand DNA" to work with, preventing the generation of schizophrenic brand names.

#### **A2. The Memorability Device Selector (Linguistic Enhancer)**

- **Description:** A control panel for linguistic "hacks" that increase recall. Options include Rhyme, Alliteration, Onomatopoeia, and Intentional Misspelling.
- **"Naming Book" Rationale:** Memorability is engineered, not accidental. Techniques like "Hard Starts" (starting with plosives like K, T, P) are proven to stick in the mind due to their "rock-like" quality.8
- **Mechanism:** Selecting "Hard Starts" adjusts the LLM's token probability weights to favor words beginning with plosive consonants. Selecting "Rhyme" activates a phonological loop constraint.
- **Strategic Value:** This feature serves as a "Delighter" for the Lean Entrepreneur, offering "ready-to-wear" stickiness that feels like a creative breakthrough without requiring deep strategic thought.

#### **A3. The Meaning Spectrum Slider**

- **Description:** A continuous slider ranging from "Literal" (Descriptive) to "Abstract" (Empty Vessel).
- **"Naming Book" Rationale:** Literal names offer clarity but lack trademark protectability. Abstract names are hard to market but easy to protect and own.8
- **Legal Implication:** This slider directly correlates with the "Fanciful/Arbitrary" scoring engine. Moving the slider toward "Abstract" increases the "Registrability Strength Score," proactively guiding High-Stakes Founders toward legally defensible options.1
- **Strategic Value:** It visually educates users on the trade-off between marketing effort and legal safety, acting as a subtle nudge toward higher-margin, defensible names.

#### **A4. The Sound Waveform Shaper (Phonaesthetics)**

- **Description:** A visual interface where users choose the "texture" of the word.
- **"Naming Book" Rationale:** Based on the "Stone vs. Rock" theory. "Stone" sounds smooth and cold (using S, L, M sounds), while "Rock" sounds hard and jagged (using K, R, T sounds). The sound of the name must match the physical reality of the product.8
- **Mechanism:** A "Smooth/Sharp" toggle that filters phonemes in the generation layer. "Sharp" boosts plosives; "Smooth" boosts sibilants and liquids.
- **Strategic Value:** This deepens the "consultative" feel of the platform, proving to the user that the AI understands branding at a sensory level, not just a semantic one.

#### **A5. The Competitive Density Triad**

- **Description:** Users input three variables: Competitor Count, Ad Budget, and Geographic Reach.
- **"Naming Book" Rationale:** The degree of "Unusualness" required depends on the noise in the market. A local coffee shop needs less distinctiveness than a global SaaS brand; in fact, too much unusualness can be detrimental for a local business.2
- **Mechanism:** High density inputs force the generator into "Coined Word" mode to ensure differentiation. Low density inputs allow for more descriptive, accessible names.
- **Strategic Value:** This aligns the output with the user's actual market reality, preventing the platform from over-engineering names for simple businesses or under-engineering names for global startups.

### **2.2 Category B: The Generative Engines (Creative Output)**

#### **B1. The Narrative Architect (Chat UI)**

- **Description:** A conversational interface that acts as a digital strategist. It interviews the user to extract the criteria (A1-A5) rather than forcing them to fill out a complex form.
- **Rationale:** This lowers the cognitive load for the "Lean Entrepreneur" who may be overwhelmed by branding jargon. It leverages conversational AI patterns to mirror the human consultation process, building trust before the pitch.9
- **Interaction Design:** Uses "Intent-Driven Shortcuts" where the AI anticipates the user's goal (e.g., "I see you're in Austin, should we look for available.coms?") and progressively discloses complexity.11

#### **B2. The Brand Canvas (Spatial UI)**

- **Description:** An infinite, 2D canvas where users can cluster names, draw relationships, and organize ideas spatially.
- **Rationale:** This is best for "High-Stakes Founders" who need "God-mode" control over their brand architecture. It supports semantic layering, allowing users to visually cluster names by theme or risk level.2
- **Technical Complexity:** Requires complex handling of zoom/pan interactions, vector rendering, and state management, similar to tools like Figma or Miro.12

#### **B3. Fanciful/Arbitrary Scoring Engine**

- **Description:** A background algorithm that scores every generated name based on its trademark strength class (Fanciful \> Arbitrary \> Suggestive \> Descriptive).
- **Rationale:** This shifts the value proposition from "sounding good" to "being ownable." It directly supports the "Certainty" pivot by proactively surfacing names that are easier to trademark.1
- **Mechanism:** The engine analyzes the semantic distance between the name and the industry description. High distance (e.g., "Apple" for computers) yields a high "Arbitrary" score.

### **2.3 Category C: The Validation & Risk Layer (De-Risking)**

#### **C1. The Traffic Light Risk System (Preliminary)**

- **Description:** Instant visual feedback on name cards. Green (Safe), Amber (Caution), Red (Blocked).
- **Rationale:** This is the "Conversion Trigger." It creates the psychological friction necessary to sell the full report. If a user falls in love with a name but sees an "Amber" light, they are compelled to pay for the details.9
- **Data Source:** A preliminary exact-match check against USPTO and WIPO databases to identify obvious conflicts.

#### **C2. Multi-Jurisdictional IP Safety Score (Deep Search)**

- **Description:** A comprehensive audit checking phonetic similarities, translation risks, and common law usage (social media, unregistered businesses).
- **Rationale:** This is the core value of the $7.99 report. It must have high recall (low false negatives) to prevent liability. AI tools often struggle with "false negatives" in trademark law, missing subtle infringements.14
- **Mechanism:** Uses advanced fuzzy matching and semantic analysis to identify "confusingly similar" marks, not just identical ones.

#### **C3. Aural Testability Score (Voice Readiness)**

- **Description:** An AI analysis of how easily a name is understood when spoken (Siri/Alexa compatibility).
- **Rationale:** This addresses the emerging need for voice commerce and voice search optimization. It adds perceived value to the premium bundle, differentiating the report from standard trademark searches.1

### **2.4 Category D: The Monetization & Ecosystem Layer**

#### **D1. The $7.99 "De-Risking Report" Gateway**

- **Description:** A secure checkout and PDF generation engine that bundles the IP score, checklist, and linguistic analysis.
- **Rationale:** This liquidates the cost of acquisition (CAC) and acts as a "Trust Builder." Once a user has paid a small amount, they are more likely to trust the platform's recommendations for higher-ticket items.2

#### **D2. Launch Readiness Checklist (Dynamic Hosting Injection)**

- **Description:** An interactive to-do list presented after name selection. Item 1: "Secure Domain." Item 2: "Setup Hosting."
- **Rationale:** This is the primary revenue driver for the Lean Entrepreneur. It dynamically routes users to HostGator (Low Budget) or WP Engine (High Performance) based on their persona.3
- **Economics:** Hosting commissions ($65-$200) far outstrip domain commissions ($2-$5), making this the critical economic engine of the platform.

#### **D3. Integrated Legal Filing Pathway**

- **Description:** A specific user flow for "Red Light" names that routes the user to a "Free Legal Consultation" form.
- **Rationale:** This monetizes high-risk users by selling the lead to attorneys. Exclusive legal leads can command $150-$300, turning a "failed" name generation into a high-value revenue event.6
- **Compliance:** Operates on a strict Pay-Per-Lead (PPL) model to avoid unethical fee-splitting.15

#### **D4. Brand Watch Subscription**

- **Description:** Recurring monthly scan for new trademark infringements ($19.99/mo).
- **Rationale:** This creates a retention layer, increasing Lifetime Value (LTV) beyond the transactional launch phase. It addresses the fear of _future_ infringement.2

## **3\. Prioritization Framework Analysis**

To decide the build order, we apply three frameworks: **MoSCoW** (for release planning), **RICE** (for quantitative scoring), and **Kano** (for customer satisfaction). This triangulation ensures that we balance business viability, user delight, and technical feasibility.

### **3.1 RICE Scoring Analysis**

**Formula:** (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort \= RICE Score.

- **Reach:** Estimated % of users who will interact with the feature within a given timeframe.
- **Impact:** 3 (Massive), 2 (High), 1 (Medium), 0.5 (Low), 0.25 (Minimal). Focus is on revenue and conversion.
- **Confidence:** % certainty in our estimates (100%, 80%, 50%).
- **Effort:** Person-Months (PM).

The following table presents the calculated RICE scores for the master feature list.

| Feature ID | Feature Name                             | Reach (%)      | Impact (1-3)   | Confidence (%) | Effort (PM) | RICE Score |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :---------- | :--------- |
| **D2**     | **Launch Readiness Checklist (Hosting)** | 100%           | 3 (Revenue)    | 100%           | 0.5         | **600**    |
| **C1**     | **Traffic Light Risk System**            | 100%           | 3 (Conversion) | 90%            | 1.0         | **270**    |
| **D1**     | **$7.99 Report Gateway**                 | 100%           | 2 (Revenue)    | 100%           | 1.0         | **200**    |
| **B1**     | **Narrative Architect (Chat UI)**        | 100%           | 2 (Retention)  | 80%            | 2.0         | **80**     |
| **C2**     | **Multi-Jurisdictional IP Score**        | 20% (Paid)     | 3 (Value)      | 80%            | 2.0         | **24**     |
| **D3**     | **Integrated Legal Filing Pathway**      | 5% (High Risk) | 3 (High CPA)   | 90%            | 1.0         | **13.5**   |
| **A2**     | **Linguistic Enhancer (Rhyme/Sound)**    | 50%            | 1 (Delighter)  | 80%            | 3.0         | **13.3**   |
| **B2**     | **Brand Canvas (Spatial UI)**            | 10% (Power)    | 2 (Diff)       | 50%            | 6.0         | **1.6**    |
| **D4**     | **Brand Watch Subscription**             | 2%             | 1 (LTV)        | 50%            | 4.0         | **0.25**   |

Strategic Insight from RICE:  
The analysis reveals a stark hierarchy of value. The Hosting Integration (D2) is the mathematical winner by a significant margin. It requires minimal dev effort (static links/tracking) but impacts 100% of users and drives the highest unit economics ($200/sale). This confirms the "Trojan Horse" thesis: the primary revenue driver is technically simple but strategically critical.  
Conversely, the **Brand Canvas (B2)** scores abysmally low (1.6). While it is a powerful differentiator for the High-Stakes Founder, the technical effort (building an infinite canvas engine) is massive compared to the initial reach. It is a "trap" feature—attractive to design but potentially fatal to the MVP timeline due to its high effort-to-impact ratio.

### **3.2 Kano Model Classification**

The Kano model categorizes features based on how they affect customer satisfaction. This helps determine what is "table stakes" versus what is a "delighter."

| Feature                         | Classification                          | Rationale                                                                                                                            |
| :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Traffic Light Risk System**   | **Must-Be (Basic)**                     | If the platform doesn't tell users if a name is taken, it is useless. Absence causes dissatisfaction; presence is expected.16        |
| **Narrative Architect (Chat)**  | **One-Dimensional (Performance)**       | The better/smarter the chat, the higher the satisfaction. It directly correlates to the perceived quality of the output.             |
| **Launch Readiness (Hosting)**  | **Indifferent (User) / Critical (Biz)** | Users expect a checklist (Basic), but the _affiliate_ nature is invisible to them. It is a business necessity, not a user delighter. |
| **Linguistic Enhancer (Rhyme)** | **Delighter (Attractive)**              | Users struggle to make names "catchy." A button that instantly makes a name rhyme is unexpected and high-value.17                    |
| **Brand Canvas (Spatial UI)**   | **Delighter (Attractive)**              | A "God-mode" interface would wow power users, but its absence won't cause the average user to churn.                                 |
| **Legal Lead Pathway**          | **Must-Be (Safety)**                    | For a user facing a "Red Light," a path to safety is a psychological necessity to resolve the anxiety created by the platform.       |

Strategic Insight from Kano:  
We must build the Must-Be features (Risk System) to enter the market. We must include at least one Delighter (Linguistic Enhancer or Chat Personality) to differentiate from generic competitors. Crucially, we should delay complex Delighters (Brand Canvas) that require high effort until the Basic features are stable and the revenue model is validated.

### **3.3 MoSCoW Prioritization**

Based on the RICE scores and Kano classification, we assign the final prioritization status.

#### **Must Have (The MVP)**

- **D2: Launch Readiness Checklist (Hosting Integration):** Non-negotiable revenue driver.
- **C1: Traffic Light Risk System:** The core "hook" for the business model.
- **D1: $7.99 De-Risking Report:** The mechanism to capture payment.
- **B1: Narrative Architect (Lite):** A simplified chat interface to ingest criteria.
- **A1/A3: Basic Tone & Meaning Inputs:** Essential to operationalize _The Naming Book_ at a basic level.
- **D3: Legal Lead Pathway:** Essential for the "High-Stakes" persona margin.

#### **Should Have (Phase 2\)**

- **A2: Linguistic Enhancer Module:** High dev effort, but high differentiation.
- **C2: Deep Multi-Jurisdictional IP Score:** Initially, we can rely on API calls to major databases. Building a proprietary deep-search engine can wait.
- **A4: Sound Waveform Shaper:** A strong "Naming Book" feature, but complex to visualize.

#### **Could Have (Phase 3\)**

- **B2: Brand Canvas (Spatial UI):** High effort, low RICE score.
- **D4: Brand Watch Subscription:** Retention is a problem for _after_ acquisition is solved.
- **C3: Aural Testability Score:** Nice to have, but not a launch blocker.

#### **Won't Have (For Now)**

- **Logo Maker:** Commoditized market. Low margin. Distraction from the core "Naming" value prop.9
- **Social Handle Reservor:** Low priority compared to Domain/Trademark availability.

---

## **4\. MVP Definition: The "Launch Certainty" Engine**

### **4.1 MVP Strategic Goal**

The goal of the MVP is **not** to build the perfect naming tool. The goal is to **validate the "Trojan Horse" thesis**:

1. Can we hook users with "Naming Book" quality names?
2. Can we scare them into buying a $7.99 report?
3. Can we convert them into $65-$200 affiliate hosting payouts?

The MVP is a validation engine for the business model, masked as a naming tool.

### **4.2 The MVP Feature Set (Detailed Specification)**

#### **Feature 1: The Narrative Architect (Lite)**

- **UX:** A mobile-responsive chat interface.
- **Function:** Instead of complex forms, the AI asks 3 key questions derived from _The Naming Book_:
  1. _Industry & Description_ (Sets the context).
  2. _Tone Selection_ (User picks 3 adjectives).
  3. _Constraint Toggle_ (Rhyme, Short, or Abstract).
- **Output:** Generates 10 names.
- **Why MVP?** It is the fastest way to deliver "Elevated Creative Quality" without building complex UI controls. It establishes the "consultative" trust required to sell the downstream report.9

#### **Feature 2: The Traffic Light Risk & Monetization Gate**

- **UX:** Result cards show the name and a "Check Availability" button.
- **Interaction:** Clicking the button runs a live check.
  - _Available:_ Shows "Green Light" \-\> Prompts "Secure this now" (Affiliate Link).
  - _High Risk:_ Shows "Red Light" \-\> Prompts "Free Legal Consult" (Lead Gen).
  - _Unsure:_ Shows "Amber Light" \-\> Prompts "Get the De-Risking Report" (Micro-transaction).
- **Why MVP?** This single feature manages the traffic routing for all three revenue streams. It is the "brain" of the monetization strategy.

#### **Feature 3: The Affiliate Injection (Post-Convert)**

- **UX:** After paying $7.99 OR clicking a "Green Light" name, the user sees the "Launch Readiness Checklist."
- **Function:**
  - Step 1: "Name Secured" (Checkmark).
  - Step 2: "Setup Hosting" (Button).
- **Logic:**
  - If User Persona \= "Budget" (detected via chat), route to **HostGator** ($65 CPA).
  - If User Persona \= "Performance" (detected via chat), route to **WP Engine** ($200 CPA).
- **Why MVP?** This is the primary revenue engine. It must be live on Day 1 to ensure unit economics are viable.

### **4.3 What We Are Postponing (The "Kill" List)**

The Brand Canvas  
We are postponing the infinite spatial UI. Developing a performant, responsive infinite canvas (like Figma/Miro) is technically momentous. It requires handling complex zoom/pan interactions, vector rendering, and state management.13 Furthermore, infinite canvases are fundamentally difficult to use on mobile screens due to pinch/zoom friction.18 Since the "Lean Entrepreneur" (our volume user) is mobile-heavy, the Canvas offers negative utility for the MVP. It slows down Time to Market (TTM) significantly for a feature that only benefits a small subset of users.  
Proprietary Legal Database  
We will use 3rd party APIs (Trademarkia, USPTO API) rather than scraping and indexing our own data. Building a proprietary database is a massive infrastructure project with high maintenance costs. Using APIs lowers upfront cost and effort, allowing us to focus on the interpretation of the data (the Risk Score) rather than the acquisition of the data.

---

## **5\. Strategic Rationale and Unit Economics Deep Dive**

### **5.1 The Affiliate Arbitrage**

The decision to prioritize the "Launch Readiness Checklist" (Feature D2) over "Creative Tools" (like the Canvas) is driven by arbitrage.

- **CAC Reality:** Acquiring a user for a naming tool via SEO/Ads might cost $10-$15.
- **Revenue Reality:** Selling a domain name nets \~$2. A $7.99 report nets \~$8. Total \= \~$10. We break even.
- **The Profit Wedge:** A single hosting conversion yields $65-$200. Even at a conservative 5% conversion rate, this adds $3.25 \- $10.00 per user in _pure profit_.
- **Conclusion:** The entire product must be designed to funnel users to the Hosting decision. The MVP feature set is optimized to remove all friction between "liking a name" and "starting a website." The naming tool is effectively a loss leader for the hosting affiliate revenue.

### **5.2 The Legal Lead "Safety Valve"**

For the "High-Stakes Founder," the risk of AI hallucination is a threat to the business, but also an opportunity.

- **The Risk:** AI models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate legal data. Benchmarking studies show that legal models can hallucinate on 1 out of 6 queries.19 A "False Negative" (saying a name is safe when it isn't) invites litigation and destroys trust.
- **The Strategy:** The "Traffic Light" system in the MVP must be tuned for **High Sensitivity**. It is better to flag a "Maybe" as "Red/High Risk" than to let it pass as Green.
- **The Monetization:** By being conservative and flagging more names as "High Risk," we drive more traffic to the "Legal Lead Pathway" (D3). We turn a technical limitation (AI inaccuracy) into a monetization feature (Human Expert Handoff). This creates a $150+ revenue event from a "failed" name generation.6 The platform effectively says, "We aren't sure, so you should talk to an expert," which is both legally prudent and financially lucrative.

---

## **6\. Technical Risk Assessment**

### **6.1 AI Hallucination in Trademark Law**

Research confirms that Generative AI struggles with the nuance of trademark law, particularly "Likelihood of Confusion" (e.g., phonetically similar but spelled differently).14 AI tools may overlook critical differences in market perception or fail to capture the subtleties of common law usage.14

- **Mitigation:** The MVP will strictly display a disclaimer: _"AI analysis is preliminary. Consult an attorney."_ The "Red Light" feature will explicitly push users _off_ the platform to human attorneys, effectively transferring the liability risk to the legal partner while capturing the lead fee. We will not claim to provide "legal advice," but rather "risk assessment."

### **6.2 Interface Complexity (Chat vs. Canvas)**

Developing a "Figma-like" canvas 12 is resource-intensive. Issues include rendering hundreds of DOM elements, managing state across an infinite coordinate system, and ensuring responsiveness.12

- **Performance:** Infinite canvases require sophisticated optimization techniques like tile-based loading and virtualization to remain performant.13
- **Mobile:** Infinite canvases are notoriously difficult to use on mobile screens due to the lack of precision in touch gestures and limited screen real estate.18
- **Conclusion:** Since the "Lean Entrepreneur" (Volume) is mobile-heavy and expects a simple linear flow, the Chat UI (Narrative Architect) is the only viable MVP interface. It aligns with the "F-shaped" scanning pattern users are accustomed to and supports multi-turn co-creation without the cognitive overhead of a spatial UI.21

---

## **7\. Roadmap: Phases 2 and 3**

### **Phase 2: The Differentiation Layer (Months 4-6)**

Once revenue is flowing from Affiliates, we invest in the "Delighters" to secure long-term SEO dominance and user retention.

1. **Linguistic Enhancer (Rhyme/Meter):** Build the specific token-masking algorithms to force rhymes and alliteration. This creates "viral" names that get shared, driving organic growth.
2. **Deep IP Search:** Integrate common law search (social media handles, GitHub repo names) to improve the "De-Risking Report" value. This reduces the False Negative Rate (FNR), crucial for maintaining trust with the High-Stakes segment.1

### **Phase 3: The High-Stakes Pivot (Months 7-12)**

Targeting the VC-backed founder and agency users who require deeper tools.

1. **Brand Canvas:** Build the spatial UI for desktop users. This enables the "God-mode" view for brand architects and justifies higher subscription pricing.
2. **Audience Validation Module:** Allow users to A/B test names with real humans (Survey integration) for a $99 upsell. This addresses the "Lack of Strategic Support/Validation" pain point.1

---

## **8\. Conclusion**

The path to market dominance for the AI De-Risking Naming Platform lies in a rigorous adherence to the "Trojan Horse" strategy. We are not building a tool to help people "brainstorm"; we are building a funnel to help people "launch safely."

By prioritizing the **Launch Readiness Checklist (Hosting)** and the **Traffic Light Risk System**, we align the product's feature set with the highest-margin revenue streams (Affiliate & Legal Leads). By postponing the complex **Brand Canvas**, we mitigate technical risk and ensure a mobile-first experience for our volume users.

The MVP defined here—**The Launch Certainty Engine**—is lean, monetizable from Day 1, and strategically defensible because it is built on the proprietary, "Naming Book" validated criteria that generic competitors cannot replicate.

### **Summary of Critical Actions**
