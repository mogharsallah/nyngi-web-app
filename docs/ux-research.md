# **UX Research: Criteria Input for the AI NamingPlatform**

## **Executive Summary: Criteria Collection as the Strategic Monetization Hook**

The rapid commoditization of generative AI naming tools necessitates a profound strategic pivot. Market viability no longer rests on the speed or volume of output, which define the current baseline for market entry, but rather on the platform's capacity to deliver certainty and mitigate existential risk.1 The proposed platform must reposition itself from a superficial utility into an essential De-Risking Platform. This strategic differentiation begins immediately in the User Experience (UX) journey, specifically during the criteria collection phase.

The criteria input mechanism must perform a critical dual function. First, it must act as the primary engagement mechanism (Pillar 1: Creative Alignment) by collecting detailed inputs regarding desired brand DNA, such as **Tones** and **Meaning**. This data is essential to train the AI to deliver **Elevated Creative Quality** and overcome the market's pervasive criticism of "Generic and Recycled Output".1 Second, and more critically, the criteria collection acts as the preemptive legal layer (Pillar 2: Risk Quantification). Inputs such as **Meaning**, **Unusualness**, and **Sound** must be designed to feed the back-end Fanciful/Arbitrary Scoring Engine, which is the foundational element that drives high-margin legal services conversion.1

To effectively capture both the high-volume core (the Lean Entrepreneur) and the high-margin segment (the High-Stakes Founder), the UX requires a mandatory early segmentation. This approach ensures the workflow adheres to the divergent user needs—**speed and friction minimization** for the primary segment versus **strategic depth and legal security** for the secondary segment.1 By tailoring the collection process, the platform maximizes throughput and revenue extraction from both archetypes.

## **I. Strategic Framework: Criteria Input as Preemptive Risk Mitigation**

Establishing criteria is not merely a preliminary step in the naming process; it is a critical necessity that moves the decision-making process beyond subjective personal preference and anchors name selection to objective strategic goals.3 The process of translating abstract branding concepts into discrete, quantifiable digital inputs is the foundation upon which the AI Naming De-Risking Platform builds its core value proposition.

### **1.1. Deconstructing the Naming Genome: Mapping Foundational Criteria to Digital Inputs**

The expert naming framework detailed in the documentation encompasses a comprehensive set of factors required to judge whether a word will make a good name.3 These conceptual criteria must be systematically translated into actionable digital inputs that calibrate the generative AI and power the risk assessment models.

- **Meaning:** This criterion exists on a spectrum, ranging from names that are strictly **Literal** or **Descriptive** (which often correlates with low legal strength and difficulty in trademark registration) to those that are highly **Metaphorical** or **Made-Up** (which possesses the highest legal strength, known as Fanciful or Arbitrary).2 The input must allow the user to define their preference across this spectrum using a **Metaphorical Depth Slider** or a **Name Type Preference Selector**. This choice is non-negotiable for preemptive legal strength.
- **Tones:** Brand tones represent the company’s personality, culture, or the aspirational attributes of the product or service.3 Tones range from concepts that are complementary (e.g., Modern and Sleek) to those that are mutually exclusive (e.g., Approachable and Exclusive).3 The platform must collect these using a **Tone Selection Checkboxes/Ranking**, ultimately requiring the user to finalize a short list of five tones that define the brand.3
- **Memorability:** This category focuses on linguistic features that enhance the recall or recognition of brand names.3 Devices include **Rhyme**, **Unusual Spelling**, **Onomatopoeia**, **Initial Hard Consonants**, **Wordplay**, **Figurative Language**, and **Brand-Name Fit**.3 While these devices are effective, the risk is that they can make a name feel contrived, necessitating a careful selection process.3 The input should be limited to a **Memorability Device Selector** where the user can select a maximum of three devices for the AI to prioritize.
- **Sound & Pronunciation:** The sound of a name significantly influences its connotation; for example, words starting with hard consonants (t, k, p, d, g, v) are generally perceived as stronger and more memorable.3 This also includes the practical aspect of ease of pronunciation, which reduces friction in communications.3 The input must address the required **Pronunciation Difficulty Selector** (ranging from Easy to Foreign/Aspirational) and the desired **Aural Clarity Preference**, which feeds the Aural Testability Score, a key future-proofing element.2
- **Unusualness:** The required degree of a name’s unusualness is determined by external factors, including competitive landscape, advertising spend, and geographic footprint.2 The platform must quantify this need using a **Competitive Intensity Questionnaire** consisting of three critical questions outlined in the foundational naming guide.3 The resultant score dictates the strategic positioning of the name relative to market saturation.
- **Unwritten Rules:** Every industry operates under a set of established, often clichéd, branding rules (e.g., using a modifier with the word “brand,” the law firm model, or relying on initialisms).3 Successful differentiation often requires deliberately avoiding these unwritten rules.3 The **Trend Avoidance Selector** input is critical, ensuring the AI model applies exclusion filters against these common industry patterns.

### **1.2. Criteria Hierarchy and Legal Protectability**

The early input collected during the criteria phase is causally linked to the final valuation and defensibility of the brand asset. This relationship establishes a clear hierarchy of importance for the input fields. The USPTO’s criteria for trademark registration success strongly favors **Fanciful** (invented words) and **Arbitrary** (existing words unrelated to the product) names.2 These categories correspond precisely to the high end of the **Meaning** spectrum (Metaphorical or Made-Up words) documented in _The Naming Book_.3

Consequently, ensuring the user defines their preference on the Meaning spectrum is the single most critical input for maximizing legal robustness, particularly for the High-Stakes Founder segment. By designing the UX to guide the user toward **Metaphorical/Made-Up** name types, the AI output is intrinsically more legally defensible. This proactive strategy ensures that the subsequent high-margin **Multi-Jurisdictional IP Safety Score** is highly actionable, thereby increasing the target conversion rate for Legal Lead Generation, estimated between 15% and 25%.1 The nature of the initial criteria input, therefore, fundamentally dictates the final legal risk profile of the name.

The comprehensive mapping of these requirements is essential for product development, linking conceptual criteria directly to technical metrics and UX formats.

## **II. Persona-Centric Design: Delineating Two UX Criteria Journeys**

The design principle for criteria collection must acknowledge that time and risk tolerance are the primary differentiators between the two target personas.1 Therefore, the UX must implement an early segmentation mechanism to minimize friction for the high-volume core while capturing the necessary strategic depth from the high-margin segment.

A definitive **Segmentation Prompt** must be the first interaction presented to the user. This prompt frames the choice in terms of outcome and risk profile:

- **Option A (Accelerated Flow):** Designed for the **Lean Entrepreneur** (Primary Segment), who requires instantaneous results, friction minimization, and a low cost.1 The prompt should focus on the tactical goal: "I need a name fast, secure a domain, and start selling."
- **Option B (Comprehensive Flow):** Designed for the **High-Stakes Founder** (Secondary Segment), who requires assurance, strategic depth, and a near-zero tolerance for legal exposure.1 The prompt should focus on strategic value: "I need a defensible brand asset, comprehensive legal checks, and strategic market validation."

This initial choice guides the user into a workflow tailored to their specific financial and operational requirements.

Table 2: UX Flow Comparison: Criteria Collection Strategy

| Feature                    | Approach 1: Accelerated Flow (Lean Entrepreneur)                                             | Approach 2: Comprehensive Flow (High-Stakes Founder)                                       |

## **III. Prescriptive UX Breakdown: Approach 1 – The Accelerated Path (Lean Entrepreneur)**

The Accelerated Flow is engineered to satisfy the Lean Entrepreneur’s mandate for speed and instantaneous results, minimizing the cognitive load associated with deep strategic analysis.1 This low-friction path is essential to driving the targeted high conversion rate of 5.0%–8.0% for the subsequent low-cost Premium De-Risking Report.1 Success in this flow depends heavily on the AI’s ability to infer complex criteria from minimal user input.

### **3.1. Stage 1: Core Identity and Friction Minimization (2 Mandatory Inputs)**

The initial inputs focus only on fundamental business identity.

- **Input 1: Industry & Target Audience:** The user selects their industry (e.g., E-commerce, Fintech, Local Retail) and defines the primary target audience (e.g., B2C, specific demographics). This is the foundational context for the AI generation model.1 This simple input allows the AI to automatically infer the most common industry trends, thus initiating the implicit filtering of **Unwritten Rules** and establishing a baseline for the required **Unusualness**.3
- **Input 2: Core Tones (The 3-Word Vibe Check):** Instead of the comprehensive five-tone selection required in the Strategic Path, the Lean Entrepreneur is constrained to selecting only **three** core tones from a curated list emphasizing speed and consumer familiarity. The selection focuses on approachable, current, fun, democratic, or traditional tones.3 This limited input is strategically vital because the user prioritizes immediate functional utility and speed.1

The restricted selection drives the AI's understanding of all _other_ naming criteria via inference. For instance, if the user selects "Fun" and "Approachable," the AI automatically weights outputs toward common, consumer-facing words, literal or semi-figurative **Meaning**, and high **Pronunciation** ease (implicitly rejecting "Exclusive" tones, foreign names, or complex figurative language).3 This process of intelligent inference is crucial to generating highly relevant output quickly, directly addressing the pain point of "Wasted time due to irrelevant suggestions" associated with commoditized competitors.1

### **3.2. Stage 2: Practical Launch Criteria (The High-Priority Blocker Check)**

The subsequent stage focuses on practical, high-priority launch blockers.

- **Input 3: Availability & Footprint:** Securing a consistent digital identity is categorized as a High Priority practical blocker, as the inability to secure a domain or social handles prevents business launch.1 This step asks two focused questions: "What is your likely geographic footprint?" (Options: Local/National/International) 3 and "Is securing the.com domain mandatory?" (Yes/No). The geographic input helps inform the back-end IP check scope.
- **Input 4: Memorability Hack Preference (Low-Friction Selection):** To quickly reinforce the Lean Entrepreneur's priority of finding a name that is "memorable and easy to find" 1, the user selects only **one** preferred memorability device. The options are curated to focus on high-impact, low-effort linguistic hacks such as Initial Hard Consonant (T, K, P, D, G, V), Rhyme, or Onomatopoeia.3 These options yield immediate creative results and enhance recall without requiring complex strategic analysis.3

### **3.3. Stage 3: Conversion Alignment and Output Calibration**

The Accelerated Flow culminates in a rapid transition to name generation.

- **The Conversion Trigger:** After the rapid criteria collection, the user is immediately taken to the output stage. A clear visual prompt must appear, explaining that deeper, high-value validation criteria—specifically the full **Multi-Jurisdictional IP Safety Score**, the **Registrability Strength Score**, and the **Aural Testability Score**—are accessible via the low-cost Premium De-Risking Report, targeted at $7.99.1
- **Final Input Check (Implicit Legal Alignment):** The AI generation model defaults to prioritizing names that are short (for memorability) and standard in spelling and pronunciation, maximizing practicality and searchability.3 By avoiding intentional misspellings or foreign names, the system minimizes the potential friction that can arise from difficult pronunciation (e.g., the tedium of spelling out an email address like *brad@evol.com*).3

## **IV. Prescriptive UX Breakdown: Approach 2 – The Comprehensive Path (High-Stakes Founder)**

The Comprehensive Flow is designed to capture the high willingness to pay demonstrated by the High-Stakes Founder for assurance, treating the name as a crucial, defensible Intellectual Property (IP) asset.1 This extended flow provides the robust data necessary to justify subsequent high-margin conversions, including Legal Lead Generation and the Audience Validation Module (AVM) Upsell.1 Every input in this path is mandatory and strategically linked to a quantifiable risk score.

### **4.1. Stage 1: Strategic Intent and Legal Risk Profile (Mandatory Inputs for Risk Scoring)**

The first stage focuses on defining the desired legal status of the name, ensuring it aligns with investor due diligence requirements.1

- **Input 1: Legal Protectability Requirement (The Fanciful/Arbitrary Mandate):** This is the foundational risk mitigation step, directly addressing the USPTO's preference for certain name types.2 The user must explicitly define their target name type based on legal criteria. The question is posed as: "What is the desired legal strength of your name (USPTO Registrability Goal)?" The options must clearly state the rationale and associated risk:
  1. **Fanciful/Arbitrary:** Highest Legal Strength, Max Protection.
  2. **Suggestive/Metaphorical:** Medium Strength, Requires Distinctiveness Proof.
  3. Descriptive/Literal: Lowest Strength, Highest Risk.2  
     The UX must visually emphasize and explain the benefits of selecting Fanciful/Arbitrary names, guiding the High-Stakes Founder toward output that is inherently more legally protectable.
- **Input 2: Meaning Spectrum Definition:** The user must explicitly define the required degree of figurative language and conceptual depth, which is vital because figurative language adds richness and depth to a new name.3 A **Metaphorical Depth Slider** (Literal/Descriptive ↔ Made-Up/Fanciful) must be utilized. This input is critical, as it overrides generic keyword matching and ensures the AI prioritizes generating deep metaphorical concepts or invented words, which is crucial for maximizing legal strength and increasing the Registrability Strength Score.
- **Input 3: Competitive Intensity Calculation (Unusualness Need):** Unlike the Lean Entrepreneur, the High-Stakes Founder must proactively quantify the need for **Unusualness** by completing the required competitive analysis questionnaire.3 This set of mandatory questions, using a Likert scale (1–5), determines the level of differentiation required:
  1. How much competition will your business have?
  2. How much does your competition spend on advertising?
  3. What is your likely geographic footprint?  
     If the aggregated score from these three questions exceeds ten points, the system must flag High Unusualness Required as a primary criterion.3 This requirement informs the AI to prioritize novel, invented, or foreign-sounding names that stand out in a saturated market.3

### **4.2. Stage 2: Linguistic and Sensory Definition (Future-Proofing and Connotation)**

This stage captures subtle linguistic preferences, demonstrating the platform’s commitment to future-proofing the brand asset.

- **Input 4: Comprehensive Tone Selection and Ranking:** The user must select and rank **five** core brand tones, ensuring clarity in strategic positioning and avoiding conflicting concepts (e.g., must choose definitively between Approachable or Exclusive).3 This deep tone input drives superior creative quality, moving the output beyond superficial naming toward strategic alignment, which is necessary to satisfy the High-Stakes Founder's demand for highly personalized branding.2
- **Input 5: Sound and Aural Testability (The Emerging Priority):** The analysis confirms that **Aural Testability and Voice Compatibility** are non-negotiable considerations for future-proofing IP assets, making this a high-priority emerging need for the High-Stakes Founder.2 This section requires two targeted questions:
  - "Do you require strong, incisive sounds (Hard Consonants: K, T, P) to convey strength?".3
  - "Linguistic Clarity Preference: Prioritize Consonant-Vowel-Consonant (CVC) structures for high voice assistant fidelity?".2  
    These inputs directly inform the high-value Aural Testability Score, which is bundled in the premium services, validating the platform's focus on maximizing ROI and long-term functionality across rising digital channels.1
- **Input 6: Pronunciation Strategy:** The user specifies if difficult pronunciation is a strategic asset or a liability. Names like Yves Saint Laurent or Lululemon leverage difficult pronunciation to create an aspirational or exclusive tone.3 The input uses a slider: Easy (Frictionless) ↔ Strategically Difficult (Aspirational/Exclusive).

### **4.3. Stage 3: Market Position and Differentiation**

The final stage ensures the name is strategically differentiated from the competition and mitigates subjective bias.

- **Input 7: Unwritten Rules Avoidance:** The High-Stakes Founder must engage in the strategic exercise of competitor analysis. The user must list several competitors and explicitly identify three naming trends to **AVOID** (e.g., Initialisms, the Law Firm Model) and one trend to **PURSE**.3 This input forces strategic engagement, ensuring the generated name is distinct and avoids the "forgettable" or "interchangeable" trap of industry clichés.3 This data is also critical for the Audience Validation Module (AVM) to test differentiation.
- **Input 8: Personal Preferences (Anti-Bias Mitigation):** To help the founder judge names more objectively and see the company from the customer's perspective, the process concludes with a mandatory reflection on subjective bias.3 The user lists three names they love and three names they hate, detailing the common characteristics of each group.3 This data helps the AI model filter out subjective biases during the subsequent generation phase.

## **V. Criteria Matrix Synthesis and Technical Integration**

The strategic value of the criteria collection flows lies in their ability to drive the platform's core monetization and de-risking architecture. The inputs collected directly translate into the key metrics of the Registrability Strength Score, the Multi-Jurisdictional IP Safety Score, and the Audience Validation Module (AVM) scoring.

### **5.1. Mapping Criteria Inputs to Scoring Engines (The De-Risking Architecture)**

The precise input fields determine the quality and actionability of the subsequent risk reports.

- **Meaning/Legal Protectability Input → Registrability Strength Score:** When the High-Stakes Founder selects "Fanciful," the AI model is weighted heavily toward Made-Up words, which possess the highest likelihood of successful USPTO registration.2 The subsequent Registrability Strength Score (a confidence percentage) confirms the name’s high legal likelihood of USPTO success.1 This quantifiable score is the primary non-negotiable value proposition for the secondary segment.
- **Unwritten Rules/Tones Input → Audience Validation Module (AVM) Scoring:** The comprehensive tone and unwritten rules inputs define the strategic market target (e.g., must be "Irreverent" and avoid "Modifier+Brand"). The AVM, offered as a paid upsell (estimated average revenue of $99.00) for the High-Stakes Founder, tests name perception against this explicitly stated strategic criteria.1 This process moves name selection from subjective preference to data-driven ROI justification.2
- **Sound/Pronunciation Input → Aural Testability Score:** The user’s preference for CVC structure and plosive sounds dictates the linguistic clarity analysis. The resulting Aural Testability Score is critical for the High-Stakes Founder concerned with future-proofing their IP asset against voice technology trends.2 This score is also utilized as a premium bundle feature in the low-cost report to justify the Lean Entrepreneur’s conversion.1

### **5.2. The Implicit Legal Risk in Accelerated Criteria**

The inherent structural design of the Accelerated Flow (Approach 1\) creates a name profile that is, by nature, legally riskier, and this risk exposure is strategically leveraged for monetization.

The Lean Entrepreneur prioritizes high Memorability (Rhyme, Wordplay) and Familiarity (Approachable Tones).1 Names optimized for these criteria often fall into the Descriptive or Suggestive categories, which correlate with lower legal strength and higher risk of USPTO rejection based on likelihood of confusion.2 Critically, the accelerated UX flow does not explicitly force the user to define their preference for Fanciful/Arbitrary names.

This structural weighting means the AI is more likely to generate names that are legally weaker but immediately appealing and memorable. Once the user forms an emotional investment in a generated name—the creative hook established by Pillar 1 1—the subsequent low-cost Premium De-Risking Report ($7.99 target) delivers the quantified risk: the potentially low Registrability Strength Score. The friction generated by this gap between the user’s emotional commitment and the quantified legal risk compels the high conversion rate (5.0%-8.0%) for the report, as the user seeks certainty to resolve the anxiety the platform has intentionally revealed.1 The flow thus transforms the inherent legal weakness derived from the Lean Entrepreneur’s preferred criteria into a high-volume conversion mechanism.

## **VI. Strategic Recommendations and KPI Assurance**

### **6.1. KPI Monitoring for UX Flow Effectiveness**

The operational effectiveness of both criteria collection flows must be continuously measured against defined revenue-centric Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

- **For Approach 1 (Accelerated Flow):** The core metric is user throughput. The **Drop-Off Rate within Criteria Collection** must be maintained below 5.0% ($\<5.0\\%$).2 Any increase in drop-off indicates the flow is too cumbersome, undermining the Lean Entrepreneur’s need for speed.1 Success is ultimately validated by the **Premium Report Conversion Rate** (Target: 5.0%–8.0%).1 This conversion rate confirms that the criteria flow was fast enough to engage the user and that the AI output quality was high enough to generate the prerequisite emotional investment before the risk score was delivered.
- **For Approach 2 (Comprehensive Flow):** The strategic success metric is data integrity. The **Criteria Completion Rate** must be maintained above 80.0% ($\>80.0\\%$). Comprehensive data input is non-negotiable for the High-Stakes Founder, as the high-margin scoring engines (IP Safety, AVM) rely on this detailed criteria for accuracy and justification of service fees. Furthermore, the **Fanciful/Arbitrary Selection Rate** must be monitored (Target: $\>75.0\\%$).2 This KPI measures the success of the UX in strategically guiding the secondary segment toward names with the highest legal defensibility, thereby maximizing the intrinsic value and protectability of the resulting IP asset.

### **6.2. Post-Criteria Strategy: Maximizing Affiliate Conversion**

Once the criteria are collected, names are generated, and risk is quantified, the UX must pivot to maximizing high-margin affiliate revenue, particularly targeting the Lean Entrepreneur.

- **The Launch Readiness Checklist Bundle:** The output generated by the Accelerated Flow, once the $7.99 Premium Report is purchased, must seamlessly integrate high-margin affiliate links.1 The user receives the "Launch Readiness Checklist," which lists confirmed domain names and available social handles. This list must contain direct, one-click purchase links for high-payout ecosystem affiliates, specifically web hosting and website builder services (e.g., Shopify, Wix), which yield significantly higher payouts, ranging from $50 to $200+ per sale.1 The act of purchasing the report signifies a firm commitment to the chosen name and a high-intent need to secure digital assets. The UX design must leverage this moment of peak intent by making the path to high-margin affiliate conversion entirely frictionless.1

## **VII. Conclusion and Strategic Imperatives**

The exhaustive analysis confirms that the strategic success of the AI Naming De-Risking Platform is dependent upon a meticulously segmented and strategically engineered criteria collection UX. The input process is not simply a data gathering exercise; it is the first tactical stage in the platform’s dual monetization strategy: establishing creative quality (the hook) while simultaneously generating the necessary data to quantify and monetize legal risk (the conversion engine).

The implementation requires adherence to the following imperatives:

1. **Mandatory Segmentation:** Implement a clear, risk-based segmentation prompt to guide users into the appropriate Accelerated or Comprehensive flow, ensuring the Lean Entrepreneur avoids strategic friction while the High-Stakes Founder is systematically forced to provide all inputs required for robust legal scoring.
2. **Input Linkage to Legal Strength:** Prioritize the **Meaning** criterion input to proactively push the High-Stakes Founder toward **Fanciful/Arbitrary** names. This ensures the generated IP is legally robust, justifying the premium pricing for legal de-risking reports and managed services.
3. **Monetization of Implicit Risk:** Design the Accelerated Flow to prioritize the Lean Entrepreneur’s need for speed and memorability hacks, which generates names of inherently lower legal strength. This gap between emotional investment and quantified legal risk drives the high conversion rate for the low-cost Premium De-Risking Report, which serves as the gateway to high-margin affiliate revenue.
4. **Future-Proofing via Input:** Integrate the **Aural Testability** preference into the criteria collection for both personas, ensuring the AI prioritizes names conducive to voice compatibility (CVC structures, clear consonants).2 This demonstrates long-term strategic value and justifies the inclusion of the Aural Testability Score in the premium service bundles.
