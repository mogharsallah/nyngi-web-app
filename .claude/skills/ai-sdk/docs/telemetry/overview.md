# Telemetry

<Note type="warning">
  AI SDK Telemetry is experimental and may change in the future.
</Note>

The AI SDK uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to collect telemetry data.
OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework designed to provide
standardized instrumentation for collecting telemetry data.

Check out the [AI SDK Observability Integrations](/providers/observability)
to see providers that offer monitoring and tracing for AI SDK applications.
