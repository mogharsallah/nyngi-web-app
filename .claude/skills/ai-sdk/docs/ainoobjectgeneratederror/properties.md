## Properties

- `message`: The error message.
- `text`: The text that was generated by the model. This can be the raw text or the tool call text, depending on the object generation mode.
- `response`: Metadata about the language model response, including response id, timestamp, and model.
- `usage`: Request token usage.
- `finishReason`: Request finish reason. For example 'length' if model generated maximum number of tokens, this could result in a JSON parsing error.
- `cause`: The cause of the error (e.g. a JSON parsing error). You can use this for more detailed error handling.
