## Preliminary Tool Results

You can return an `AsyncIterable` over multiple results.
In this case, the last value from the iterable is the final tool result.

This can be used in combination with generator functions to e.g. stream status information
during the tool execution:

```ts
tool({
  description: 'Get the current weather.',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string(),
  }),
  async *execute({ location }) {
    yield {
      status: 'loading' as const,
      text: `Getting weather for ${location}`,
      weather: undefined,
    };

    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));

    const temperature = 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10;

    yield {
      status: 'success' as const,
      text: `The weather in ${location} is ${temperature}°F`,
      temperature,
    };
  },
});
```
