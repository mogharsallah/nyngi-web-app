## `llms.txt` (for Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Claude etc.)

You can access the entire AI SDK documentation in Markdown format at [ai-sdk.dev/llms.txt](/llms.txt). This can be used to ask any LLM (assuming it has a big enough context window) questions about the AI SDK based on the most up-to-date documentation.

### Example Usage

For instance, to prompt an LLM with questions about the AI SDK:

1. Copy the documentation contents from [ai-sdk.dev/llms.txt](/llms.txt)
2. Use the following prompt format:

```prompt
Documentation:
{paste documentation here}
---
Based on the above documentation, answer the following:
{your question}
```
