## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `deepgram` from `@ai-sdk/deepgram`:

```ts
import { deepgram } from '@ai-sdk/deepgram';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createDeepgram` from `@ai-sdk/deepgram` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createDeepgram } from '@ai-sdk/deepgram';

const deepgram = createDeepgram({
  // custom settings, e.g.
  fetch: customFetch,
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Deepgram provider instance:

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.
