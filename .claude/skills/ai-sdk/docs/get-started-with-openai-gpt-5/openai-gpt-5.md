## OpenAI GPT-5

OpenAI's GPT-5 represents their latest advancement in language models, offering powerful new features including verbosity control for tailored response lengths, integrated web search capabilities, reasoning summaries for transparency, and native support for text, images, audio, and PDFs. The model is available in three variants: `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini` for faster, more cost-effective processing, and `gpt-5-nano` for ultra-efficient operations.

### Prompt Engineering for GPT-5

Here are the key strategies for effective prompting:

#### Core Principles

1. **Be precise and unambiguous**: Avoid contradictory or ambiguous instructions. GPT-5 performs best with clear, explicit guidance.
2. **Use structured prompts**: Leverage XML-like tags to organize different sections of your instructions for better clarity.
3. **Natural language works best**: While being precise, write prompts as you would explain to a skilled colleague.

#### Prompting Techniques

**1. Agentic Workflow Control**

- Adjust the `reasoningEffort` parameter to calibrate model autonomy
- Set clear stop conditions and define explicit tool call budgets
- Provide guidance on exploration depth and persistence

```ts
// Example with reasoning effort control
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Analyze this complex dataset and provide insights.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      reasoningEffort: 'high', // Increases autonomous exploration
    },
  },
});
```

**2. Structured Prompt Format**
Use XML-like tags to organize your prompts:

```
<context_gathering>
Goal: Extract key performance metrics from the report
Method: Focus on quantitative data and year-over-year comparisons
Early stop criteria: Stop after finding 5 key metrics
</context_gathering>

<task>
Analyze the attached financial report and identify the most important metrics.
</task>
```

**3. Tool Calling Best Practices**

- Use tool preambles to provide clear upfront plans
- Define safe vs. unsafe actions for different tools
- Create structured updates about tool call progress

**4. Verbosity Control**

- Use the `textVerbosity` parameter to control response length programmatically
- Override with natural language when needed for specific contexts
- Balance between conciseness and completeness

**5. Optimization Workflow**

- Start with a clear, simple prompt
- Test and identify areas of ambiguity or confusion
- Iteratively refine by removing contradictions
- Consider using OpenAI's Prompt Optimizer tool for complex prompts
- Document successful patterns for reuse
