Drizzle ORM is dialect-specific, slim, performant and serverless-ready **by design**.  

We've spent a lot of time to make sure you have best-in-class SQL dialect support, including Postgres, MySQL, and others.

Drizzle operates natively through industry-standard database drivers. We support all major **[PostgreSQL](/docs/get-started-postgresql)**, **[MySQL](/docs/get-started-mysql)** or **[SQLite](/docs/get-started-sqlite)** drivers out there, and we're adding new ones **[really fast](https://twitter.com/DrizzleORM/status/1653082492742647811?s=20)**.
