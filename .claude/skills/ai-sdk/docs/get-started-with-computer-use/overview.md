# Get started with Computer Use

With the [release of Computer Use in Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use), you can now direct AI models to interact with computers like humans do - moving cursors, clicking buttons, and typing text. This capability enables automation of complex tasks while leveraging Claude's advanced reasoning abilities.

The AI SDK is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like Anthropic's Claude alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. In this guide, you will learn how to integrate Computer Use into your AI SDK applications.

<Note>
  Computer Use is currently in beta with some [ limitations
  ](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use#understand-computer-use-limitations).
  The feature may be error-prone at times. Anthropic recommends starting with
  low-risk tasks and implementing appropriate safety measures.
