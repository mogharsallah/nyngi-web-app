## Choose Your Approach

Consider these key factors:

- **Flexibility vs Control** - How much freedom does the LLM need vs how tightly you must constrain its actions?
- **Error Tolerance** - What are the consequences of mistakes in your use case?
- **Cost Considerations** - More complex systems typically mean more LLM calls and higher costs
- **Maintenance** - Simpler architectures are easier to debug and modify

**Start with the simplest approach that meets your needs**. Add complexity only when required by:

1. Breaking down tasks into clear steps
2. Adding tools for specific capabilities
3. Implementing feedback loops for quality control
4. Introducing multiple agents for complex workflows

Let's look at examples of these patterns in action.
