## Customized UI

`useCompletion` also provides ways to manage the prompt via code, show loading and error states, and update messages without being triggered by user interactions.

### Loading and error states

To show a loading spinner while the chatbot is processing the user's message, you can use the `isLoading` state returned by the `useCompletion` hook:

```tsx
const { isLoading, ... } = useCompletion()

return(
  <>
    {isLoading ? <Spinner /> : null}
  </>
)
```

Similarly, the `error` state reflects the error object thrown during the fetch request. It can be used to display an error message, or show a toast notification:

```tsx
const { error, ... } = useCompletion()

useEffect(() => {
  if (error) {
    toast.error(error.message)
  }
}, [error])

// Or display the error message in the UI:
return (
  <>
    {error ? <div>{error.message}</div> : null}
  </>
)
```

### Controlled input

In the initial example, we have `handleSubmit` and `handleInputChange` callbacks that manage the input changes and form submissions. These are handy for common use cases, but you can also use uncontrolled APIs for more advanced scenarios such as form validation or customized components.

The following example demonstrates how to use more granular APIs like `setInput` with your custom input and submit button components:

```tsx
const { input, setInput } = useCompletion();

return (
  <>
    <MyCustomInput value={input} onChange={value => setInput(value)} />
  </>
);
```

### Cancelation

It's also a common use case to abort the response message while it's still streaming back from the AI provider. You can do this by calling the `stop` function returned by the `useCompletion` hook.

```tsx
const { stop, isLoading, ... } = useCompletion()

return (
  <>
    <button onClick={stop} disabled={!isLoading}>Stop</button>
  </>
)
```

When the user clicks the "Stop" button, the fetch request will be aborted. This avoids consuming unnecessary resources and improves the UX of your application.

### Throttling UI Updates

<Note>This feature is currently only available for React.</Note>

By default, the `useCompletion` hook will trigger a render every time a new chunk is received.
You can throttle the UI updates with the `experimental_throttle` option.

```tsx filename="page.tsx" highlight="2-3"
const { completion, ... } = useCompletion({
  // Throttle the completion and data updates to 50ms:
  experimental_throttle: 50
})
```
