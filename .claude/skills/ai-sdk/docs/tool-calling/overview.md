# Tool Calling

As covered under Foundations, [tools](/docs/foundations/tools) are objects that can be called by the model to perform a specific task.
AI SDK Core tools contain several core elements:

- **`description`**: An optional description of the tool that can influence when the tool is picked.
- **`inputSchema`**: A [Zod schema](/docs/foundations/tools#schemas) or a [JSON schema](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/json-schema) that defines the input parameters. The schema is consumed by the LLM, and also used to validate the LLM tool calls.
- **`execute`**: An optional async function that is called with the inputs from the tool call. It produces a value of type `RESULT` (generic type). It is optional because you might want to forward tool calls to the client or to a queue instead of executing them in the same process.
- **`strict`**: _(optional, boolean)_ Enables strict tool calling when supported by the provider

<Note className="mb-2">
  You can use the [`tool`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/tool) helper function to
  infer the types of the `execute` parameters.
</Note>

The `tools` parameter of `generateText` and `streamText` is an object that has the tool names as keys and the tools as values:

```ts highlight="6-17"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool, stopWhen } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

<Note>
  When a model uses a tool, it is called a "tool call" and the output of the
  tool is called a "tool result".
</Note>

Tool calling is not restricted to only text generation.
You can also use it to render user interfaces (Generative UI).
