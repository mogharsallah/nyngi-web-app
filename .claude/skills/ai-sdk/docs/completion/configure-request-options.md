## Configure Request Options

By default, the `useCompletion` hook sends a HTTP POST request to the `/api/completion` endpoint with the prompt as part of the request body. You can customize the request by passing additional options to the `useCompletion` hook:

```tsx
const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useCompletion({
  api: '/api/custom-completion',
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'your_token',
  },
  body: {
    user_id: '123',
  },
  credentials: 'same-origin',
});
```

In this example, the `useCompletion` hook sends a POST request to the `/api/completion` endpoint with the specified headers, additional body fields, and credentials for that fetch request. On your server side, you can handle the request with these additional information.
