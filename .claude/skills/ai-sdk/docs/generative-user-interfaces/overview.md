# Generative User Interfaces

Generative user interfaces (generative UI) is the process of allowing a large language model (LLM) to go beyond text and "generate UI". This creates a more engaging and AI-native experience for users.

At the core of generative UI are [ tools ](/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling), which are functions you provide to the model to perform specialized tasks like getting the weather in a location. The model can decide when and how to use these tools based on the context of the conversation.

Generative UI is the process of connecting the results of a tool call to a React component. Here's how it works:

1. You provide the model with a prompt or conversation history, along with a set of tools.
2. Based on the context, the model may decide to call a tool.
3. If a tool is called, it will execute and return data.
4. This data can then be passed to a React component for rendering.

By passing the tool results to React components, you can create a generative UI experience that's more engaging and adaptive to your needs.
