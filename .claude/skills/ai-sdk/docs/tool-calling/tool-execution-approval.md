## Tool Execution Approval

By default, tools with an `execute` function run automatically as the model calls them. You can require approval before execution by setting `needsApproval`:

```ts highlight="13"
import { tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const runCommand = tool({
  description: 'Run a shell command',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    command: z.string().describe('The shell command to execute'),
  }),
  needsApproval: true,
  execute: async ({ command }) => {
    // your command execution logic here
  },
});
```

This is useful for tools that perform sensitive operations like executing commands, processing payments, modifying data, and more potentially dangerous actions.

### How It Works

When a tool requires approval, `generateText` and `streamText` don't pause execution. Instead, they complete and return `tool-approval-request` parts in the result content. This means the approval flow requires two calls to the model: the first returns the approval request, and the second (after receiving the approval response) either executes the tool or informs the model that approval was denied.

Here's the complete flow:

1. Call `generateText` with a tool that has `needsApproval: true`
2. Model generates a tool call
3. `generateText` returns with `tool-approval-request` parts in `result.content`
4. Your app requests an approval and collects the user's decision
5. Add a `tool-approval-response` to the messages array
6. Call `generateText` again with the updated messages
7. If approved, the tool runs and returns a result. If denied, the model sees the denial and responds accordingly.

### Handling Approval Requests

After calling `generateText` or `streamText`, check `result.content` for `tool-approval-request` parts:

```ts
import { type ModelMessage, generateText } from 'ai';

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [
  { role: 'user', content: 'Remove the most recent file' },
];
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: { runCommand },
  messages,
});

messages.push(...result.response.messages);

for (const part of result.content) {
  if (part.type === 'tool-approval-request') {
    console.log(part.approvalId); // Unique ID for this approval request
    console.log(part.toolCall); // Contains toolName, input, etc.
  }
}
```

To respond, create a `tool-approval-response` and add it to your messages:

```ts
import { type ToolApprovalResponse } from 'ai';

const approvals: ToolApprovalResponse[] = [];

for (const part of result.content) {
  if (part.type === 'tool-approval-request') {
    const response: ToolApprovalResponse = {
      type: 'tool-approval-response',
      approvalId: part.approvalId,
      approved: true, // or false to deny
      reason: 'User confirmed the command', // Optional context for the model
    };
    approvals.push(response);
  }
}

// add approvals to messages
messages.push({ role: 'tool', content: approvals });
```

Then call `generateText` again with the updated messages. If approved, the tool executes. If denied, the model receives the denial and can respond accordingly.

<Note>
  When a tool execution is denied, consider adding a system instruction like
  "When a tool execution is not approved, do not retry it" to prevent the model
  from attempting the same call again.
</Note>

### Dynamic Approval

You can make approval decisions based on tool input by providing an async function:

```ts
const paymentTool = tool({
  description: 'Process a payment',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    amount: z.number(),
    recipient: z.string(),
  }),
  needsApproval: async ({ amount }) => amount > 1000,
  execute: async ({ amount, recipient }) => {
    return await processPayment(amount, recipient);
  },
});
```

In this example, only transactions over $1000 require approval. Smaller transactions execute automatically.

### Tool Execution Approval with useChat

When using `useChat`, the approval flow is handled through UI state. See [Chatbot Tool Usage](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot-tool-usage#tool-execution-approval) for details on handling approvals in your UI with `addToolApprovalResponse`.
