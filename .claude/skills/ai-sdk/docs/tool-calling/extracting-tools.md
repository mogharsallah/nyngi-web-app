## Extracting Tools

Once you start having many tools, you might want to extract them into separate files.
The `tool` helper function is crucial for this, because it ensures correct type inference.

Here is an example of an extracted tool:

```ts filename="tools/weather-tool.ts" highlight="1,4-5"
import { tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// the `tool` helper function ensures correct type inference:
export const weatherTool = tool({
  description: 'Get the weather in a location',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
  }),
  execute: async ({ location }) => ({
    location,
    temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
  }),
});
```
