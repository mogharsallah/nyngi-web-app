## Structured Workflows

Agents are flexible and powerful, but non-deterministic. When you need reliable, repeatable outcomes with explicit control flow, use core functions with structured workflow patterns combining:

- Conditional statements for explicit branching
- Standard functions for reusable logic
- Error handling for robustness
- Explicit control flow for predictability
