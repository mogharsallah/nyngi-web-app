## Create a Route Handler

Create a route handler, `app/api/chat/route.ts` and add the following code:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { streamText, convertToModelMessages, type UIMessage } from 'ai';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    messages: await convertToModelMessages(messages),
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

Let's take a look at what is happening in this code:

1. Define an asynchronous `POST` request handler and extract `messages` from the body of the request. The `messages` variable contains a history of the conversation between you and the agent and provides the agent with the necessary context to make the next generation.
2. Convert the UI messages to model messages using `convertToModelMessages`, which transforms the UI-focused message format to the format expected by the language model.
3. Call [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text), which is imported from the `ai` package. This function accepts a configuration object that contains a `model` provider and `messages` (converted in step 2). You can pass additional [settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings) to further customise the model's behaviour.
4. The `streamText` function returns a [`StreamTextResult`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#result-object). This result object contains the [ `toUIMessageStreamResponse` ](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#to-ui-message-stream-response) function which converts the result to a streamed response object.
5. Finally, return the result to the client to stream the response.

This Route Handler creates a POST request endpoint at `/api/chat`.
