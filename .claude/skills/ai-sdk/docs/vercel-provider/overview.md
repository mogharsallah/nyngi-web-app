# Vercel Provider

The [Vercel](https://vercel.com) provider gives you access to the [v0 API](https://vercel.com/docs/v0/api), designed for building modern web applications. The v0 models support text and image inputs and provide fast streaming responses.

You can create your Vercel API key at [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/chat/settings/keys).

<Note>
  The v0 API is currently in beta and requires a Premium or Team plan with
  usage-based billing enabled. For details, visit the [pricing
  page](https://v0.dev/pricing). To request a higher limit, contact Vercel at
  support@v0.dev.
