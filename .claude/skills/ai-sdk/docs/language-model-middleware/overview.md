# Language Model Middleware

Language model middleware is a way to enhance the behavior of language models
by intercepting and modifying the calls to the language model.

It can be used to add features like guardrails, RAG, caching, and logging
in a language model agnostic way. Such middleware can be developed and
distributed independently from the language models that they are applied to.
