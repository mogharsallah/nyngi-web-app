# Drizzle extension for Prisma

If you have an existing project with Prisma and want to try Drizzle or gradually adopt it,
you can use our first-class extension that will add Drizzle API to your Prisma client. It will allow you to
use Drizzle alongside your Prisma queries reusing your existing DB connection.
