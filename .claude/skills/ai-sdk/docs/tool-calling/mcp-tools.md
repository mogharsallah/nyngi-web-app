## MCP Tools

The AI SDK supports connecting to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to access their tools.
MCP enables your AI applications to discover and use tools across various services through a standardized interface.

For detailed information about MCP tools, including initialization, transport options, and usage patterns, see the [MCP Tools documentation](/docs/ai-sdk-core/mcp-tools).

### AI SDK Tools vs MCP Tools

In most cases, you should define your own AI SDK tools for production applications. They provide full control, type safety, and optimal performance. MCP tools are best suited for rapid development iteration and scenarios where users bring their own tools.

| Aspect                 | AI SDK Tools                                              | MCP Tools                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type Safety**        | Full static typing end-to-end                             | Dynamic discovery at runtime                          |
| **Execution**          | Same process as your request (low latency)                | Separate server (network overhead)                    |
| **Prompt Control**     | Full control over descriptions and schemas                | Controlled by MCP server owner                        |
| **Schema Control**     | You define and optimize for your model                    | Controlled by MCP server owner                        |
| **Version Management** | Full visibility over updates                              | Can update independently (version skew risk)          |
| **Authentication**     | Same process, no additional auth required                 | Separate server introduces additional auth complexity |
| **Best For**           | Production applications requiring control and performance | Development iteration, user-provided tools            |
