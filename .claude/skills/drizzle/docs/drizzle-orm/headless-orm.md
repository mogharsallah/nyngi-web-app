## Headless ORM? 
First and foremost, Drizzle is a library and a collection of complementary opt-in tools. 

**ORM** stands for _object relational mapping_, and developers tend to call Django-like or Spring-like tools an ORM. 
We truly believe it's a misconception based on legacy nomenclature, and we call them **data frameworks**.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️💔">
  With data frameworks you have to build projects **around them** and not **with them**.
</Callout>

**Drizzle** lets you build your project the way you want, without interfering with your project or structure. 

Using Drizzle you can define and manage database schemas in TypeScript, access your data in a SQL-like 
or relational way, and take advantage of opt-in tools 
to push your developer experience _through the roof_. 🤯
