# Generating Structured Data

While text generation can be useful, your use case will likely call for generating structured data.
For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data.

Many language models are capable of generating structured data, often defined as using "JSON modes" or "tools".
However, you need to manually provide schemas and then validate the generated data as LLMs can produce incorrect or incomplete structured data.

The AI SDK standardises structured object generation across model providers
using the `output` property on [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text)
and [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text).
You can use [Zod schemas](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/zod-schema), [Valibot](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/valibot-schema), or [JSON schemas](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/json-schema) to specify the shape of the data that you want,
and the AI model will generate data that conforms to that structure.

<Note>
  Structured output generation is part of the `generateText` and `streamText`
  flow. This means you can combine it with tool calling in the same request.
