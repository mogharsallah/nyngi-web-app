## Data Part Reconciliation

When you write to a data part with the same ID, the client automatically reconciles and updates that part. This enables powerful dynamic experiences like:

- **Collaborative artifacts** - Update code, documents, or designs in real-time
- **Progressive data loading** - Show loading states that transform into final results
- **Live status updates** - Update progress bars, counters, or status indicators
- **Interactive components** - Build UI elements that evolve based on user interaction

The reconciliation happens automatically - simply use the same `id` when writing to the stream.
