## Explain SQL Queries

Next, let's add the ability to explain SQL queries in plain English. This feature helps users understand how the generated SQL query works by breaking it down into logical sections.
As with the SQL query generation, you'll need a prompt to guide the model when explaining queries.

Let's craft a prompt for the explain query functionality:

```txt
You are a SQL (postgres) expert. Your job is to explain to the user write a SQL query you wrote to retrieve the data they asked for. The table schema is as follows:
unicorns (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  company VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  valuation DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  date_joined DATE,
  country VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  city VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  industry VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  select_investors TEXT NOT NULL
);

When you explain you must take a section of the query, and then explain it. Each "section" should be unique. So in a query like: "SELECT * FROM unicorns limit 20", the sections could be "SELECT *", "FROM UNICORNS", "LIMIT 20".
If a section doesn't have any explanation, include it, but leave the explanation empty.
```

Like the prompt for generating SQL queries, you provide the model with the schema of the database. Additionally, you provide an example of what each section of the query might look like. This helps the model understand the structure of the query and how to break it down into logical sections.

### Create a Server Action

Add a new Server Action to generate explanations for SQL queries.

This action takes two parameters - the original natural language input and the generated SQL query.

```ts filename="app/actions.ts"
/* ...rest of the file... */

export const explainQuery = async (input: string, sqlQuery: string) => {
  'use server';
  try {
    const result = await generateObject({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      system: `You are a SQL (postgres) expert. ...`, // SYSTEM PROMPT AS ABOVE - OMITTED FOR BREVITY
      prompt: `Explain the SQL query you generated to retrieve the data the user wanted. Assume the user is not an expert in SQL. Break down the query into steps. Be concise.

      User Query:
      ${input}

      Generated SQL Query:
      ${sqlQuery}`,
    });
    return result.object;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    throw new Error('Failed to generate query');
  }
};
```

This action uses the `generateObject` function again. However, you haven't defined the schema yet. Let's define it in another file so it can also be used as a type in your components.

Update your `lib/types.ts` file to include the schema for the explanations:

```ts filename="lib/types.ts"
import { z } from 'zod';

/* ...rest of the file... */

export const explanationSchema = z.object({
  section: z.string(),
  explanation: z.string(),
});

export type QueryExplanation = z.infer<typeof explanationSchema>;
```

This schema defines the structure of the explanation that the model will generate. Each explanation will have a `section` and an `explanation`. The `section` is the part of the query being explained, and the `explanation` is the plain English explanation of that section. Go back to your `actions.ts` file and import and use the `explanationSchema`:

```ts filename="app/actions.ts" highlight="2,19,20"
// other imports
import { explanationSchema } from '@/lib/types';

/* ...rest of the file... */

export const explainQuery = async (input: string, sqlQuery: string) => {
  'use server';
  try {
    const result = await generateObject({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      system: `You are a SQL (postgres) expert. ...`, // SYSTEM PROMPT AS ABOVE - OMITTED FOR BREVITY
      prompt: `Explain the SQL query you generated to retrieve the data the user wanted. Assume the user is not an expert in SQL. Break down the query into steps. Be concise.

      User Query:
      ${input}

      Generated SQL Query:
      ${sqlQuery}`,
      schema: explanationSchema,
      output: 'array',
    });
    return result.object;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    throw new Error('Failed to generate query');
  }
};
```

<Note>
  You can use `output: "array"` to indicate to the model that you expect an
  array of objects matching the schema to be returned.
</Note>

### Update query viewer

Next, update the `query-viewer.tsx` component to display these explanations. The `handleExplainQuery` function is called every time the user clicks the question icon button on the right side of the query. Let's update this function to use the new `explainQuery` action:

```ts filename="components/query-viewer.tsx" highlight="2,10,11"
/* ...other imports... */
import { explainQuery } from '@/app/actions';

/* ...rest of the component... */

const handleExplainQuery = async () => {
  setQueryExpanded(true);
  setLoadingExplanation(true);

  const explanations = await explainQuery(inputValue, activeQuery);
  setQueryExplanations(explanations);

  setLoadingExplanation(false);
};

/* ...rest of the component... */
```

Now when users click the explanation button (the question mark icon), the component will:

1. Show a loading state
2. Send the active SQL query and the users natural language query to your Server Action
3. The model will generate an array of explanations
4. The explanations will be set in the component state and rendered in the UI

Submit a new query and then click the explanation button. Hover over different elements of the query. You should see the explanations for each section!
