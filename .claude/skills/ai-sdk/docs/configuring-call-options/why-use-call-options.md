## Why Use Call Options?

When you need agent behavior to change based on runtime context:

- **Add dynamic context** - Inject retrieved documents, user preferences, or session data into prompts
- **Select models dynamically** - Choose faster or more capable models based on request complexity
- **Configure tools per request** - Pass user location to search tools or adjust tool behavior
- **Customize provider options** - Set reasoning effort, temperature, or other provider-specific settings

Without call options, you'd need to create multiple agents or handle configuration logic outside the agent.
