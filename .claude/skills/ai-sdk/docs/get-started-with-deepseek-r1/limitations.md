## Limitations

While DeepSeek R1 models are powerful, they have certain limitations:

- No tool-calling support: DeepSeek R1 cannot directly interact with APIs or external tools.
- No object generation support: DeepSeek R1 does not support structured object generation. However, you can combine it with models that support structured object generation (like gpt-4o-mini) to generate objects. See the [structured object generation with a reasoning model recipe](/cookbook/node/generate-object-reasoning) for more information.
