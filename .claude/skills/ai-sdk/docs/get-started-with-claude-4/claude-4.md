## Claude 4

Claude 4 is Anthropic's most advanced model family to date, offering exceptional capabilities across reasoning, instruction following, coding, and knowledge tasks. Available in two variants—Sonnet and Opus—Claude 4 delivers state-of-the-art performance with enhanced reliability and control. Claude 4 builds on the extended thinking capabilities introduced in Claude 3.7, allowing for even more sophisticated problem-solving through careful, step-by-step reasoning.

Claude 4 excels at complex reasoning, code generation and analysis, detailed content creation, and agentic capabilities, making it ideal for powering sophisticated AI workflows, customer-facing agents, and applications requiring nuanced understanding and responses. Claude Opus 4 is an excellent coding model, leading on SWE-bench (72.5%) and Terminal-bench (43.2%), with the ability to sustain performance on long-running tasks that require focused effort and thousands of steps. Claude Sonnet 4 significantly improves on Sonnet 3.7, excelling in coding with 72.7% on SWE-bench while balancing performance and efficiency.

### Prompt Engineering for Claude 4 Models

Claude 4 models respond well to clear, explicit instructions. The following best practices can help achieve optimal performance:

1. **Provide explicit instructions**: Clearly state what you want the model to do, including specific steps or formats for the response.
2. **Include context and motivation**: Explain why a task is being performed to help the model better understand the underlying goals.
3. **Avoid negative examples**: When providing examples, only demonstrate the behavior you want to see, not what you want to avoid.
