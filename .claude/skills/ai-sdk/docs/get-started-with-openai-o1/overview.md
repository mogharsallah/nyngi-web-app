# Get started with OpenAI o1

With the [release of OpenAI's o1 series models](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/), there has never been a better time to start building AI applications, particularly those that require complex reasoning capabilities.

The [AI SDK](/) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI o1 alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.
