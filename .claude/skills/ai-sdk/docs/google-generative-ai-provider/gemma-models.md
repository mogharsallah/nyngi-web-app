## Gemma Models

You can use [Gemma models](https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/) with the Google Generative AI API.

Gemma models don't natively support the `systemInstruction` parameter, but the provider automatically handles system instructions by prepending them to the first user message. This allows you to use system instructions with Gemma models seamlessly:

```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: google('gemma-3-27b-it'),
  system: 'You are a helpful assistant that responds concisely.',
  prompt: 'What is machine learning?',
});
```

The system instruction is automatically formatted and included in the conversation, so Gemma models can follow the guidance without any additional configuration.
