## Multi-Step Calls (using stopWhen)

With the `stopWhen` setting, you can enable multi-step calls in `generateText` and `streamText`. When `stopWhen` is set and the model generates a tool call, the AI SDK will trigger a new generation passing in the tool result until there are no further tool calls or the stopping condition is met.

<Note>
  The `stopWhen` conditions are only evaluated when the last step contains tool
  results.
</Note>

By default, when you use `generateText` or `streamText`, it triggers a single generation. This works well for many use cases where you can rely on the model's training data to generate a response. However, when you provide tools, the model now has the choice to either generate a normal text response, or generate a tool call. If the model generates a tool call, its generation is complete and that step is finished.

You may want the model to generate text after the tool has been executed, either to summarize the tool results in the context of the users query. In many cases, you may also want the model to use multiple tools in a single response. This is where multi-step calls come in.

You can think of multi-step calls in a similar way to a conversation with a human. When you ask a question, if the person does not have the requisite knowledge in their common knowledge (a model's training data), the person may need to look up information (use a tool) before they can provide you with an answer. In the same way, the model may need to call a tool to get the information it needs to answer your question where each generation (tool call or text generation) is a step.

### Example

In the following example, there are two steps:

1. **Step 1**
   1. The prompt `'What is the weather in San Francisco?'` is sent to the model.
   1. The model generates a tool call.
   1. The tool call is executed.
1. **Step 2**
   1. The tool result is sent to the model.
   1. The model generates a response considering the tool result.

```ts highlight="18-19"
import { z } from 'zod';
import { generateText, tool, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const { text, steps } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5), // stop after a maximum of 5 steps if tools were called
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```

<Note>You can use `streamText` in a similar way.</Note>

### Steps

To access intermediate tool calls and results, you can use the `steps` property in the result object
or the `streamText` `onFinish` callback.
It contains all the text, tool calls, tool results, and more from each step.

#### Example: Extract tool results from all steps

```ts highlight="3,9-10"
import { generateText } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const { steps } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
  // ...
});

// extract all tool calls from the steps:
const allToolCalls = steps.flatMap(step => step.toolCalls);
```

### `onStepFinish` callback

When using `generateText` or `streamText`, you can provide an `onStepFinish` callback that
is triggered when a step is finished,
i.e. all text deltas, tool calls, and tool results for the step are available.
When you have multiple steps, the callback is triggered for each step.

```tsx highlight="5-7"
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
  onStepFinish({ text, toolCalls, toolResults, finishReason, usage }) {
    // your own logic, e.g. for saving the chat history or recording usage
  },
});
```

### `prepareStep` callback

The `prepareStep` callback is called before a step is started.

It is called with the following parameters:

- `model`: The model that was passed into `generateText`.
- `stopWhen`: The stopping condition that was passed into `generateText`.
- `stepNumber`: The number of the step that is being executed.
- `steps`: The steps that have been executed so far.
- `messages`: The messages that will be sent to the model for the current step.
- `experimental_context`: The context passed via the `experimental_context` setting (experimental).

You can use it to provide different settings for a step, including modifying the input messages.

```tsx highlight="5-7"
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
  prepareStep: async ({ model, stepNumber, steps, messages }) => {
    if (stepNumber === 0) {
      return {
        // use a different model for this step:
        model: modelForThisParticularStep,
        // force a tool choice for this step:
        toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'tool1' },
        // limit the tools that are available for this step:
        activeTools: ['tool1'],
      };
    }

    // when nothing is returned, the default settings are used
  },
});
```

#### Message Modification for Longer Agentic Loops

In longer agentic loops, you can use the `messages` parameter to modify the input messages for each step. This is particularly useful for prompt compression:

```tsx
prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber, steps, messages }) => {
  // Compress conversation history for longer loops
  if (messages.length > 20) {
    return {
      messages: messages.slice(-10),
    };
  }

  return {};
},
```

#### Provider Options for Step Configuration

You can use `providerOptions` in `prepareStep` to pass provider-specific configuration for each step. This is useful for features like Anthropic's code execution container persistence:

```tsx
import { forwardAnthropicContainerIdFromLastStep } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';

// Propagate container ID from previous step for code execution continuity
prepareStep: forwardAnthropicContainerIdFromLastStep,
```
