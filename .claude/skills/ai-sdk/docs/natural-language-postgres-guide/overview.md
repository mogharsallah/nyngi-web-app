# Natural Language Postgres Guide

In this guide, you will learn how to build an app that uses AI to interact with a PostgreSQL database using natural language.

The application will:

- Generate SQL queries from a natural language input
- Explain query components in plain English
- Create a chart to visualise query results

You can find a completed version of this project at [natural-language-postgres.vercel.app](https://natural-language-postgres.vercel.app).
