## Span Details

### Basic LLM span information

Many spans that use LLMs (`ai.generateText`, `ai.generateText.doGenerate`, `ai.streamText`, `ai.streamText.doStream`,
`ai.generateObject`, `ai.generateObject.doGenerate`, `ai.streamObject`, `ai.streamObject.doStream`) contain the following attributes:

- `resource.name`: the functionId that was set through `telemetry.functionId`
- `ai.model.id`: the id of the model
- `ai.model.provider`: the provider of the model
- `ai.request.headers.*`: the request headers that were passed in through `headers`
- `ai.response.providerMetadata`: provider specific metadata returned with the generation response
- `ai.settings.maxRetries`: the maximum number of retries that were set
- `ai.telemetry.functionId`: the functionId that was set through `telemetry.functionId`
- `ai.telemetry.metadata.*`: the metadata that was passed in through `telemetry.metadata`
- `ai.usage.completionTokens`: the number of completion tokens that were used
- `ai.usage.promptTokens`: the number of prompt tokens that were used

### Call LLM span information

Spans that correspond to individual LLM calls (`ai.generateText.doGenerate`, `ai.streamText.doStream`, `ai.generateObject.doGenerate`, `ai.streamObject.doStream`) contain
[basic LLM span information](#basic-llm-span-information) and the following attributes:

- `ai.response.model`: the model that was used to generate the response. This can be different from the model that was requested if the provider supports aliases.
- `ai.response.id`: the id of the response. Uses the ID from the provider when available.
- `ai.response.timestamp`: the timestamp of the response. Uses the timestamp from the provider when available.
- [Semantic Conventions for GenAI operations](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans/)
  - `gen_ai.system`: the provider that was used
  - `gen_ai.request.model`: the model that was requested
  - `gen_ai.request.temperature`: the temperature that was set
  - `gen_ai.request.max_tokens`: the maximum number of tokens that were set
  - `gen_ai.request.frequency_penalty`: the frequency penalty that was set
  - `gen_ai.request.presence_penalty`: the presence penalty that was set
  - `gen_ai.request.top_k`: the topK parameter value that was set
  - `gen_ai.request.top_p`: the topP parameter value that was set
  - `gen_ai.request.stop_sequences`: the stop sequences
  - `gen_ai.response.finish_reasons`: the finish reasons that were returned by the provider
  - `gen_ai.response.model`: the model that was used to generate the response. This can be different from the model that was requested if the provider supports aliases.
  - `gen_ai.response.id`: the id of the response. Uses the ID from the provider when available.
  - `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`: the number of prompt tokens that were used
  - `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`: the number of completion tokens that were used

### Basic embedding span information

Many spans that use embedding models (`ai.embed`, `ai.embed.doEmbed`, `ai.embedMany`, `ai.embedMany.doEmbed`) contain the following attributes:

- `ai.model.id`: the id of the model
- `ai.model.provider`: the provider of the model
- `ai.request.headers.*`: the request headers that were passed in through `headers`
- `ai.settings.maxRetries`: the maximum number of retries that were set
- `ai.telemetry.functionId`: the functionId that was set through `telemetry.functionId`
- `ai.telemetry.metadata.*`: the metadata that was passed in through `telemetry.metadata`
- `ai.usage.tokens`: the number of tokens that were used
- `resource.name`: the functionId that was set through `telemetry.functionId`

### Tool call spans

Tool call spans (`ai.toolCall`) contain the following attributes:

- `operation.name`: `"ai.toolCall"`
- `ai.operationId`: `"ai.toolCall"`
- `ai.toolCall.name`: the name of the tool
- `ai.toolCall.id`: the id of the tool call
- `ai.toolCall.args`: the input parameters of the tool call
- `ai.toolCall.result`: the output result of the tool call. Only available if the tool call is successful and the result is serializable.
