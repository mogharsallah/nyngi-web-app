# Workflow Patterns

Combine the building blocks from the [overview](/docs/agents/overview) with these patterns to add structure and reliability to your agents:

- [Sequential Processing](#sequential-processing-chains) - Steps executed in order
- [Parallel Processing](#parallel-processing) - Independent tasks run simultaneously
- [Evaluation/Feedback Loops](#evaluator-optimizer) - Results checked and improved iteratively
- [Orchestration](#orchestrator-worker) - Coordinating multiple components
- [Routing](#routing) - Directing work based on context
