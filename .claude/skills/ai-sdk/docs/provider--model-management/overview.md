# Provider & Model Management

When you work with multiple providers and models, it is often desirable to manage them in a central place
and access the models through simple string ids.

The AI SDK offers [custom providers](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/custom-provider) and
a [provider registry](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/provider-registry) for this purpose:

- With **custom providers**, you can pre-configure model settings, provide model name aliases,
  and limit the available models.
- The **provider registry** lets you mix multiple providers and access them through simple string ids.

You can mix and match custom providers, the provider registry, and [middleware](/docs/ai-sdk-core/middleware) in your application.
