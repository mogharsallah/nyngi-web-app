## Next Steps

You've built a Slack chatbot powered by the AI SDK! Here are some ways you could extend it:

1. Add memory for specific users to give the LLM context of previous interactions
2. Implement more tools like database queries or knowledge base searches
3. Add support for rich message formatting with blocks
4. Add analytics to track usage patterns

<Note>
  In a production environment, it is recommended to implement a robust queueing
  system to ensure messages are properly handled.
