## Language Models

The Azure OpenAI provider instance is a function that you can invoke to create a language model:

```ts
const model = azure('your-deployment-name');
```

You need to pass your deployment name as the first argument.

### Reasoning Models

Azure exposes the thinking of `DeepSeek-R1` in the generated text using the `<think>` tag.
You can use the `extractReasoningMiddleware` to extract this reasoning and expose it as a `reasoning` property on the result:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { wrapLanguageModel, extractReasoningMiddleware } from 'ai';

const enhancedModel = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: azure('your-deepseek-r1-deployment-name'),
  middleware: extractReasoningMiddleware({ tagName: 'think' }),
});
```

You can then use that enhanced model in functions like `generateText` and `streamText`.

<Note>
  The Azure provider calls the Responses API by default (unless you specify e.g.
  `azure.chat`).
</Note>

### Example

You can use OpenAI language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

OpenAI language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

<Note>
  Azure OpenAI sends larger chunks than OpenAI. This can lead to the perception
  that the response is slower. See [Troubleshooting: Azure OpenAI Slow To
  Stream](/docs/troubleshooting/common-issues/azure-stream-slow)
</Note>

### Provider Options

When using OpenAI language models on Azure, you can configure provider-specific options using `providerOptions.openai`. More information on available configuration options are on [the OpenAI provider page](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai#language-models).

```ts highlight="12-14,22-24"
const messages = [
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: [
      {
        type: 'text',
        text: 'What is the capital of the moon?',
      },
      {
        type: 'image',
        image: 'https://example.com/image.png',
        providerOptions: {
          openai: { imageDetail: 'low' },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      reasoningEffort: 'low',
    },
  },
});
```

### Chat Models

<Note>
  The URL for calling Azure chat models will be constructed as follows:
  `https://RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/chat/completions?api-version=v1`
</Note>

You can create models that call the Azure OpenAI chat completions API using the `.chat()` factory method:

```ts
const model = azure.chat('your-deployment-name');
```

Azure OpenAI chat models support also some model specific settings that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: azure.chat('your-deployment-name'),
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a robot.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      logitBias: {
        // optional likelihood for specific tokens
        '50256': -100,
      },
      user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for OpenAI chat models:

- **logitBias** _Record&lt;number, number&gt;_

  Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in
  the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You
  can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically,
  the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.
  The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should
  decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100
  should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

  As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the token from being generated.

- **logprobs** _boolean | number_

  Return the log probabilities of the tokens. Including logprobs will increase
  the response size and can slow down response times. However, it can
  be useful to better understand how the model is behaving.

  Setting to true will return the log probabilities of the tokens that
  were generated.

  Setting to a number will return the log probabilities of the top n
  tokens that were generated.

- **parallelToolCalls** _boolean_

  Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use. Default to true.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

### Responses Models

Azure OpenAI uses responses API as default with the `azure(deploymentName)` factory method.

```ts
const model = azure('your-deployment-name');
```

Further configuration can be done using OpenAI provider options.
You can validate the provider options using the `OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions` type.

```ts
import { azure, OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      parallelToolCalls: false,
      store: false,
      user: 'user_123',
      // ...
    } satisfies OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions,
  },
  // ...
});
```

The following provider options are available:

- **parallelToolCalls** _boolean_
  Whether to use parallel tool calls. Defaults to `true`.

- **store** _boolean_
  Whether to store the generation. Defaults to `true`.

- **metadata** _Record&lt;string, string&gt;_
  Additional metadata to store with the generation.

- **previousResponseId** _string_
  The ID of the previous response. You can use it to continue a conversation. Defaults to `undefined`.

- **instructions** _string_
  Instructions for the model.
  They can be used to change the system or developer message when continuing a conversation using the `previousResponseId` option.
  Defaults to `undefined`.

- **user** _string_
  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Defaults to `undefined`.

- **reasoningEffort** _'low' | 'medium' | 'high'_
  Reasoning effort for reasoning models. Defaults to `medium`. If you use `providerOptions` to set the `reasoningEffort` option, this model setting will be ignored.

- **strictJsonSchema** _boolean_
  Whether to use strict JSON schema validation. Defaults to `false`.

The Azure OpenAI provider also returns provider-specific metadata:

```ts
const { providerMetadata } = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
});

const openaiMetadata = providerMetadata?.openai;
```

The following OpenAI-specific metadata is returned:

- **responseId** _string_
  The ID of the response. Can be used to continue a conversation.

- **cachedPromptTokens** _number_
  The number of prompt tokens that were a cache hit.

- **reasoningTokens** _number_
  The number of reasoning tokens that the model generated.

<Note>
  The providerMetadata is only returned with the default responses API, and is
  not supported when using 'azure.chat' or 'azure.completion'
</Note>

#### Web Search Tool

The Azure OpenAI responses API supports web search(preview) through the `azure.tools.webSearchPreview` tool.

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('gpt-4.1-mini'),
  prompt: 'What happened in San Francisco last week?',
  tools: {
    web_search_preview: azure.tools.webSearchPreview({
      // optional configuration:
      searchContextSize: 'low',
      userLocation: {
        type: 'approximate',
        city: 'San Francisco',
        region: 'California',
      },
    }),
  },
  // Force web search tool (optional):
  toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'web_search_preview' },
});

console.log(result.text);

// URL sources directly from `results`
const sources = result.sources;
for (const source of sources) {
  console.log('source:', source);
}
```

<Note>
  The tool must be named `web_search_preview` when using Azure OpenAI's web
  search(preview) functionality. This name is required by Azure OpenAI's API
  specification and cannot be customized.
</Note>

<Note>
  The 'web_search_preview' tool is only supported with the default responses
  API, and is not supported when using 'azure.chat' or 'azure.completion'
</Note>

#### File Search Tool

The Azure OpenAI provider supports file search through the `azure.tools.fileSearch` tool.

You can force the use of the file search tool by setting the `toolChoice` parameter to `{ type: 'tool', toolName: 'file_search' }`.

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'What does the document say about user authentication?',
  tools: {
    file_search: azure.tools.fileSearch({
      // optional configuration:
      vectorStoreIds: ['vs_123', 'vs_456'],
      maxNumResults: 10,
      ranking: {
        ranker: 'auto',
      },
    }),
  },
  // Force file search tool:
  toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'file_search' },
});
```

<Note>
  The tool must be named `file_search` when using Azure OpenAI's file search
  functionality. This name is required by Azure OpenAI's API specification and
  cannot be customized.
</Note>

<Note>
  The 'file_search' tool is only supported with the default responses API, and
  is not supported when using 'azure.chat' or 'azure.completion'
</Note>

#### Image Generation Tool

Azure OpenAI's Responses API supports multi-modal image generation as a provider-defined tool.
Availability is restricted to specific models (for example, `gpt-5` variants).

```ts
import { createAzure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const azure = createAzure({
  headers: {
    'x-ms-oai-image-generation-deployment': 'gpt-image-1', // use your own image model deployment
  },
});

const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('gpt-5'),
  prompt:
    'Generate an image of an echidna swimming across the Mozambique channel.',
  tools: {
    image_generation: azure.tools.imageGeneration({ outputFormat: 'png' }),
  },
});

for (const toolResult of result.staticToolResults) {
  if (toolResult.toolName === 'image_generation') {
    const base64Image = toolResult.output.result;
  }
}
```

<Note>
  The tool must be named `image_generation` when using Azure OpenAI's image
  generation functionality. This name is required by Azure OpenAI's API
  specification and cannot be customized.
</Note>

<Note>
  The 'image_generation' tool is only supported with the default responses API,
  and is not supported when using 'azure.chat' or 'azure.completion'
</Note>

<Note>
  To use image_generation, you must first create an image generation model. You
  must add a deployment specification to the header
  `x-ms-oai-image-generation-deployment`. Please note that the Responses API
  model and the image generation model must be in the same resource.
</Note>

<Note>
  When you set `store: false`, then previously generated images will not be
  accessible by the model. We recommend using the image generation tool without
  setting `store: false`.
</Note>

#### Code Interpreter Tool

The Azure OpenAI provider supports the code interpreter tool through the `azure.tools.codeInterpreter` tool. This allows models to write and execute Python code.

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('gpt-5'),
  prompt: 'Write and run Python code to calculate the factorial of 10',
  tools: {
    code_interpreter: azure.tools.codeInterpreter({
      // optional configuration:
      container: {
        fileIds: ['assistant-123', 'assistant-456'], // optional file IDs to make available
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

The code interpreter tool can be configured with:

- **container**: Either a container ID string or an object with `fileIds` to specify uploaded files that should be available to the code interpreter

<Note>
  The tool must be named `code_interpreter` when using Azure OpenAI's code
  interpreter functionality. This name is required by Azure OpenAI's API
  specification and cannot be customized.
</Note>

<Note>
  The 'code_interpreter' tool is only supported with the default responses API,
  and is not supported when using 'azure.chat' or 'azure.completion'
</Note>

#### PDF support

The Azure OpenAI provider supports reading PDF files.
You can pass PDF files as part of the message content using the `file` type:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'What is an embedding model?',
        },
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/ai.pdf'),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
          filename: 'ai.pdf', // optional
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

The model will have access to the contents of the PDF file and
respond to questions about it.
The PDF file should be passed using the `data` field,
and the `mediaType` should be set to `'application/pdf'`.

<Note>
  Reading PDF files are only supported with the default responses API, and is
  not supported when using 'azure.chat' or 'azure.completion'
</Note>

### Completion Models

You can create models that call the completions API using the `.completion()` factory method.
The first argument is the model id.
Currently only `gpt-35-turbo-instruct` is supported.

```ts
const model = azure.completion('your-gpt-35-turbo-instruct-deployment');
```

OpenAI completion models support also some model specific settings that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: azure.completion('your-gpt-35-turbo-instruct-deployment'),
  prompt: 'Write a haiku about coding.',
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      echo: true, // optional, echo the prompt in addition to the completion
      logitBias: {
        // optional likelihood for specific tokens
        '50256': -100,
      },
      suffix: 'some text', // optional suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text
      user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
    },
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Azure OpenAI completion models:

- **echo**: _boolean_

  Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion.

- **logitBias** _Record&lt;number, number&gt;_

  Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in
  the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You
  can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically,
  the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.
  The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should
  decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100
  should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

  As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the &lt;|endoftext|&gt;
  token from being generated.

- **logprobs** _boolean | number_

  Return the log probabilities of the tokens. Including logprobs will increase
  the response size and can slow down response times. However, it can
  be useful to better understand how the model is behaving.

  Setting to true will return the log probabilities of the tokens that
  were generated.

  Setting to a number will return the log probabilities of the top n
  tokens that were generated.

- **suffix** _string_

  The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.
