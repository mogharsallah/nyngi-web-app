## Implementation Plan

To build a multi-modal agent, you will need to:

- Create a Route Handler to handle incoming chat messages and generate responses.
- Wire up the UI to display chat messages, provide a user input, and handle submitting new messages.
- Add the ability to upload images and PDFs and attach them alongside the chat messages.
