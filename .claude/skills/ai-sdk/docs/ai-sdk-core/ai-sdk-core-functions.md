## AI SDK Core Functions

AI SDK Core has various functions designed for [text generation](./generating-text), [structured data generation](./generating-structured-data), and [tool usage](./tools-and-tool-calling).
These functions take a standardized approach to setting up [prompts](./prompts) and [settings](./settings), making it easier to work with different models.

- [`generateText`](/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-text): Generates text and [tool calls](./tools-and-tool-calling).
  This function is ideal for non-interactive use cases such as automation tasks where you need to write text (e.g. drafting email or summarizing web pages) and for agents that use tools.
- [`streamText`](/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-text): Stream text and tool calls.
  You can use the `streamText` function for interactive use cases such as [chat bots](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot) and [content streaming](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/completion).
- [`generateObject`](/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-structured-data): Generates a typed, structured object that matches a [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema.
  You can use this function to force the language model to return structured data, e.g. for information extraction, synthetic data generation, or classification tasks.
- [`streamObject`](/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-structured-data): Stream a structured object that matches a Zod schema.
  You can use this function to [stream generated UIs](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/object-generation).
