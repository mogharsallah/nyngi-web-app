## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

You can connect your own provider credentials to use with Vercel AI Gateway. This lets you use your existing provider accounts and access private resources.

To set up BYOK, add your provider credentials in your Vercel team's AI Gateway settings. Once configured, AI Gateway automatically uses your credentials. No code changes are needed.

Learn more in the [BYOK documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/byok).
