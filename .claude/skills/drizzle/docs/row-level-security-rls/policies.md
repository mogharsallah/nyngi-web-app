## Policies

To fully leverage RLS, you can define policies within a Drizzle table.

<Callout title='info'>
In PostgreSQL, policies should be linked to an existing table. Since policies are always associated with a specific table, we decided that policy definitions should be defined as a parameter of `pgTable`
</Callout>

**Example of pgPolicy with all available properties**
```ts
import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { integer, pgPolicy, pgRole, pgTable } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const admin = pgRole('admin');

export const users = pgTable('users', {
	id: integer(),
}, (t) => [
	pgPolicy('policy', {
		as: 'permissive',
		to: admin,
		for: 'delete',
		using: sql``,
		withCheck: sql``,
	}),
]);
```

**Policy options**
|                          |                                                                                                                                           |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `as`                     | Possible values are `permissive` or `restrictive`                                                                                         |
| `to`                     | Specifies the role to which the policy applies. Possible values include `public`, `current_role`, `current_user`, `session_user`, or any other role name as a string. You can also reference a `pgRole` object. |
| `for`                    | Defines the commands this policy will be applied to. Possible values are `all`, `select`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`.                   |
| `using`                  | The SQL statement that will be applied to the `USING` part of the policy creation statement.                                              |
| `withCheck`              | An SQL statement that will be applied to the `WITH CHECK` part of the policy creation statement.                                          |


**Link Policy to an existing table**

There are situations where you need to link a policy to an existing table in your database. 
The most common use case is with database providers like `Neon` or `Supabase`, where you need to add a policy 
to their existing tables. In this case, you can use the `.link()` API

```ts
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import { pgPolicy } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
import { authenticatedRole, realtimeMessages } from "drizzle-orm/supabase";

export const policy = pgPolicy("authenticated role insert policy", {
  for: "insert",
  to: authenticatedRole,
  using: sql``,
}).link(realtimeMessages);
```
