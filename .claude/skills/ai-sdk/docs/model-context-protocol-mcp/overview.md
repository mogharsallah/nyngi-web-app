# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The AI SDK supports connecting to [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers to access their tools, resources, and prompts.
This enables your AI applications to discover and use capabilities across various services through a standardized interface.

<Note>
  If you're using OpenAI's Responses API, you can also use the built-in
  `openai.tools.mcp` tool, which provides direct MCP server integration without
  needing to convert tools. See the [OpenAI provider
  documentation](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai#mcp-tool) for details.
